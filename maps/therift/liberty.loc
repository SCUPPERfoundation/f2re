      <name>Liberty Market</name>
      <desc>The place is crawling..  literally. Rodent and insect life alike scurry over the floor and tables, heaping load of goods before ever-watchful white rats. Through the chaos rolls a cleaning droid, battered and scratched. Atop the droid sits an enormous rodent.  A brilliant red jewel hangs at the rat&apos;s neck.  The droid is flanked by a phalanx of lesser rats and the other creatures appear to cower away as it comes closer. A doorway sits to the east.  The exit is south.</desc>

      <name>Eco-dome E1</name>
      <desc>This transparent dome is flooded with light from the small star at the center of The Rift System. At once time it may have provided fresh food for the crew of the ship but now it seems to be a playground and habitat for ship rats. The hum of insects is louder here than in the corridors beyond. Large expanses of the dome floor are cultivated and being worked by a variety of small creatures. Several of the large rats you can see are wearing harnesses hung with primitive weapons.</desc>

      <name>The Bridge</name>
      <desc>The bridge must have been well sealed through the years as there is only a thin layer of dust covering the control consoles. A few lights blink here and there on panels, indicating that some of the ship functions are still running on the scant power provided by the reactor core and some jury-rigged solar power collectors that have been plugged into the main grid. Readings indicate that the ship could remain powered at the present level for at least another three thousand years, barring a heavy meteor strike.</desc>
      <desc>Seated in the captain&apos;s chair is a sinister looking black robot with a gold crown upon it&apos;s head.  The lights of his sensors and processors must have long since dimmed and he sits lifelessly staring at the viewscreen which shows the stormy planet Ritual and the brightly swirling expanse of The Rift beyond. As you step further into the room a holographic image of the robot flickers into life beside the command console and bows in greeting.</desc>

      <name>DSS Liberty Shuttle Bay</name>
      <desc>The cavernous shuttle bay of the DSS Liberty is half filled with debris.  Along with your shuttle there is another craft in the bay.  One of the skids seems to have given way on the other shuttle and a greenish algae has grown over much of the super-structure. The ancient bulkheads run with moisture. The air is breathable but has a heavy odor of decay. Small scratching sounds come from the piles of rubble around the bay.</desc>

      <desc>Boxes and crates line the damp and dirty walls.  The flooring is hardly visible beneath a layer of packed grime and mud. There is an incessant buzzing of insects and the scratching of small feet.  A large black beetle pulling a cart suddenly rushes past your feet and disappears through a doorway to the north.  The corridor continues to the south.</desc>

      <desc>You emerge from from the maintenance shaft into all out war! White rats rush by you wearing harnesses studded with sharp pieces of broken glass. Miniature catapults, tended by rats, are firing missiles made of just about anything available at a group of grey rats who appear to be trying to guard a large barricade that blocks the corridor to the south. Injured rodents lie, battered and bleeding, around your feet. More rats pour from the maintenance hatch that leads down to Section F. They enter the fray with teeth and claws flying. There are piles of rodent bodies and piles of broken equipment along the corridor walls. Debris and the barricade block the exits.</desc>

      <desc>As you step towards the bridge door you notice a security scanner on the wall. A sliding door slams shut behind you, cutting off any retreat from the alcove.</desc>
      <desc>    A klaxon sounds! Then a metallic voice announces:</desc>
      <desc>   &quot;INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT! Unauthorized access attempts WILL result in vaporization&quot;</desc>
      <desc>    There&apos;s a humming noise as hidden machinery begins to warm up behind the walls of the alcove.</desc>
      <desc>     &quot;Scanning unidentified life-form for authorization. This process will take a few seconds.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>     The scanner emits a lurid red light which travels over your personage from top to bottom. The seconds tick by as the scanner performs it&apos;s task.</desc>

      <desc>Ferns and mosses have really taken hold in the mess hall.  Water trickles from a sink to the floor below and forms a pool before sinking out of sight through a crack in distressed metal.  Handkerchief sized fields of greenery are being tended by mice and beetles.  An impressively large grey rat appears to be overseeing the operation from a counter top.</desc>

      <desc>A large section of the wall here is occupied by a huge fan shaped fungus. In the shadow of the structure is what could only be described as a miniature mud condo complex.  Mice scurry in and out of the holes in the hardened mud.  The corridor continues south. Another hallway leads east and there is a door to the west.</desc>

      <desc>The lighting flickers weakly behind  centuries of dirt build up.  The walkway is perhaps half it&apos;s original width as the walls are lined with odd structures made from small pieces of metal, plastic, ceramics, and anything else small enough for rodents and beetles to carry. The structures have hundreds of openings and little furry bodies scurry in and out. the corridor continues east and west.</desc>

      <name>The Barricade</name>
      <desc>The corridor comes to an abrupt end here, sealed with debris except for a gap at the top of the make-shift barricade to the north. The barricade appears to be guarded by a dozen or so extremely nasty looking grey rats. Some of them are scarred and battered looking, but if anything that only serves to make them look more ferocious.</desc>
      <desc>Periodically, loud bangs can be heard from the other side of the barricade and puffs of smoke and dust drift over the top.  The rats respond to each bang with much lashing of tails and scurrying around.  With bites and chittering, they herd a group of mice to make repairs to the barricade with whatever junk they can find.</desc>

      <name>Grey Corridor. Section C</name>
      <desc>The walls are grey and featureless, blended by a layer of dust into the floor. The corridor to the east has been sealed off by an emergency bulkhead. Ice crystals glimmer in the unsteady overhead light and tell tales of the coldness of space on the other side of the door. To the west is an archway that appears to lead into a small lounge area.  North of your position is an alcove that is the entrance to the bridge.  You know this because there&apos;s a sign that says &quot;Bridge Access. Secure Area. Unauthorized entrants will be vaporized!&quot; above it.</desc>

      <name>Command Deck Lounge</name>
      <desc>The ambient lighting of the old command deck lounge flickers and hums as you walk into the room. Shreds of red upholstery still remain on the couches but look as though they might crumble to dust at the first touch. A vid-screen hangs at a precarious angle on the wall and the faded slip-cover of an entertainment disc sits on the coffee table.  The title of the movie is just barely legible.. Rocky CCXVIII.. which is strange because the last one to be released, as far as you remember, was CLXXIV.</desc>
      <desc>    In one corner is a retro-design gum ball machine. The golfball sized gobstoppers inside look rather grey and rock-like but the metal -handle- that you would turn to release a sweet, still seems to be in good condition.</desc>

      <name>Ruined Grav-Shaft</name>
      <desc>The corridor ends in what once was a grav shaft and is now a hole in the floor.  The stench coming up the shaft is putrid. The shaft walls are coated in stinking slime and what looks like small animal bones, fur and rodent droppings.  There are some cables hanging in the shaft but there&apos;s no way to know if they will support your weight.</desc>

      <desc>A dust-encrusted sign on the wall reads &quot;Command Deck&quot;.  There are cables hanging in the defunct grav-shaft which might provide a way down if you&apos;re limber enough to climb them. To the north is a grey corridor. This deck appears much cleaner and devoid of the rodentia which inhabit the deck below, though the join between wall and floor has disappeared under a thick layer of dust.</desc>

The walls are mostly obscured by vines and fungi and the atmosphere is humid but the view from the large view port is spectacular. The planet Ritual shines blue and white against the brilliant swirls of colour in The Rift. Far off in the distance, the blackness of space can be seen through the clear path to the link. The beacon blinks like a sparkle in a huge dark eye.</desc>

      <desc>Amid the miniature rain-forest sits a crate of vacuum-packed rations. If they are fit to eat, it would be a miracle. The rodents seem to have left them alone in favour of fresher fare that grows wild within the confines of the ship. Water drips into a ceramic sink from a faucet decorated with a stalactite of minerals. The surface of the water trembles slightly and you feel the very small vibration of the ship&apos;s engines beneath your feet. Some of the vines are in flower around a garbage chute.  The exit is west.</desc>

      <name>Engineering Section Hallway</name>
      <desc>The hallway ends and the metal walkway you are on creaks and groans.  It&apos;s suspended over the void that surrounds the engine core which hums softly and emits a pale blue light. Looking down, you cannot see the bottom of the vast space. On the other side of the gap, to the south, is a glass-enclosed office but the center section of the walkway has been retracted. The control to extend the walkway on your side of the gap is smashed. The one on the south side looks intact. It&apos;s a large red button by the office door. But you cannot reach it from here and the gap is certainly too wide to jump.</desc>

      <desc>The north-south corridor continues to present you with obstacles in the form of vines, planets and fungi. The sound of chittering and squeaking comes from a door to the west, and peeking through you can see an army of white rats gathered there. One very large rat in a leather harness is doing most of the noise-making and the others seem to be listening.  If you didn&apos;t know better, you&apos;d think it was a council of war.</desc>

The floor is spongy with moss beneath your feet and agaist the western wall a beetle colony has erected an almost symmetrical habitat, decorated with small pieces of glass and plastic.  The design is gaudy but looks surprisingly well planned.</desc>

      <desc>Even with the cracked and cloudy medical terminals, the sickbay looks far cleaner than anywhere else you&apos;ve seen on the ship. The reason soon becomes apparent as a single medical droid trundles out from beneath one of the beds and in a flash of laser scalpel light, kills a mouse that had somehow become trapped in the sickbay. The droid creaks its way over to a hatch in the wall and disappears.</desc>

      <desc>The office walls are transparent, allowing a three hundred and sixty degree view. The desks are all but turned to dust and a drawer that might have once been locked lies broken on the floor. Inside the drawer is a box of security badges, the kind that can be clipped to clothing and read by a scanner. The badges are still in reasonable condition and you could probably just pick one up.</desc>
      <desc>One wall is stained in the shape of some letters.. F.. O.. R.  but the rest have been bleached by time and are unreadable. There is a big red button by the door to the north.</desc>

      <desc>Bed frames can be seen above the growing vegetation, marking this as once being a crew dormitory. There the similarity ends. A trickle of water runs down one wall and divides into shallow canals that irrigate the rest of the room. To the left of the door is a dirt-filled open suitcase. A few leaves have been deposited there and are being devoured by grubs and larvae. Any grubs making it up the sides of the suitcase are quickly knocked back down or eaten by an attending rat. It&apos;s as if they were being farmed.</desc>

As you watch, a couple of large white rats goad an injured grey rat towards the open shaft. Though the grey rat tries to fight back, the white ones are fitter and stronger and they eventually force the grey over the edge.  It falls, squealing, into the blackness of the pit.</desc>
