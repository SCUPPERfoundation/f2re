      <name>The Sample Room</name>
      <desc>Like exhibits at a zoo, creatures ranging from large toothy worms to something that looks like a green paper airplane inhabit clear cells, separated by a walkway. A light blinks over the cell at the end of the row. As you approach movement from the cell opposite catches your attention.</desc>
      <desc>A beautiful humanoid female with long coppery hair, wearing a rough woven wrap and several bruises on her body is gesticulating wildly at you. The only thing in the other cell is a white shoe.</desc>
      <desc>     The universal translator on the cell door display begins to scroll a string of words. &quot;wall eat he not quiet go in waste you me let go feed people marks tell me food I dead not waste&quot; You surmise it is translating body movement as the female has not uttered a sound. On a hunch you tap the glass of the empty cell.  A distortion on the wall of the cell suddenly becomes a mass of teeth on a large kite shaped body that hits the glass hard where you tapped.</desc>
      <desc>    &quot;Wall eat&quot; she nods.</desc>

      <name>Recovery Room</name>
      <desc>You awake slowly on a gurney to the sound of snickering.  A middle-aged man in a lab coat and a young nurse in a very short uniform have their backs to you and are looking at something on a monitor.. something apparently quiet hilarious.  The nurse notices you stirring and taps the man on the shoulder.  He quickly flicks off the monitor and turns towards you.</desc>
      <desc>     &quot;Welcome back to the land of the living! Pleasure having you here&quot; His smile and the large tub of lubricant on the desk are enough to give you a slightly uneasy feeling.  &quot;Now you&apos;ll need to take it easy for a day or so.  A little stiffness or soreness is normal after cloning.  Come back and see me if you have any questions.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>    The nurse giggles and begins to load implements, including a large speculum and several probes into an autoclave while the Doctor busies himself with packing away the cameras.</desc>

      <desc>     Along one wall is a glass incubator containing hundreds of small plant seedlings, each neatly labeled with a file number. At the far end of the room is what appears to be a clean room complete with all the analytical equipment a modern scientist could wish for. The one occupant of the cleanroom is staring at a monitor and shaking his head but you cannot hear what he is muttering through the partition and he doesn&apos;t notice your presence.</desc>

      <desc>Standing on the shuttle platform just below a huge round crystal aperture, the swirling storm walls of the research station curving outwards and down around you, feels like standing just below the neck of a giant fishbowl.   In a chandelier of glittering light, crystal stalactites hang from the rim of the launch aperture, projecting the holo-hurricane which disguises this Federation outpost from the planet&apos;s inhabitants.</desc>
      <desc>A klaxon sounds!  Green lightning from several stalactites strobes over a small shuttle entering the station and for a moment a dark sinister shape can be seen detaching from the hull and drifting up through open column in the center of the Holo-storm.</desc>

      <desc>A salesman with slicked-back hair, a thin mustache and a gaudy tartan suit tells you he has just what you&apos;re looking for before pointing out what he calls &quot;The Cadillac of fusion driven transportation&quot;.  It takes a moment to realize he&apos;s pointing to a dented and rusty shuttle craft in Mary-Kay pink.  If that doesn&apos;t appeal to you, he also has a shuttle that&apos;s painted black with red and yellow flames on the side with dingle berries around the view ports.  Apparently the desirable feature of this model is the addition of extra attitude jets on the nose that make the front end bounce up and down in a ridiculous manner while in a holding pattern over the landing pad.</desc>

      <name>Orientation Building</name>
      <desc>Your footsteps echo on the smooth marbled floor of the orientation building.  Numbered holo displays recite information as you move from one to the next. Details about the holo-storm that disguises the research station, so that the native humanoids remain unaware of its presence, offer no explanation for why it has to be a secret. Other displays detail the geology of the planet and more tell you of the dangers facing anyone who leaves the safety of the Research Station.</desc>
      <desc>    Half listening to the class, you manage to gather some facts.  The planet is mineral poor. Indigenous fauna and flora is either toxic or lacks the minerals to sustain a human population for long.  No large land masses means tropical storms can last for years over the vast oceans.  There is a particularly nasty pathogen in the water which invades blood cells and lies dormant for years before breaking down your vascular system. A few steps lead down to more displays.

      <desc>Info-displays on this level talk about some of the life indigenous life forms of the planet... most notably a large predator named a Mantra.  The info-holo shows a three legged, smooth skinned creature the size of a large dog, tethered to a steak and growing more frantic by the second.  A section of the rock wall behind the creature suddenly seems to peel away and envelope the hapless beast like a giant sea ray wrapping itself around its victim. Time lapse holography speeds up the gruesome digestion process and you witness the mantra slowly uncurl and take flight.</desc>
      <desc>    The unemotional voice of the info-holo informs you that the name &quot;Mantra&quot; was chosen partly for the creature&apos;s resemblance to the manta ray and partly because of the words repeated over and over by the first explorers to witness an attack by the predator. &quot;Don&apos;t let it get me! Don&apos;t let it get me!&quot;</desc>

There are dark holes, possibly ancient volcanic vents, in the floor which luckily is lit by just one or two flickering light strings still.  If you were to fall into one of the holes your chances of being found are slim to none. The north end of the tunnel is completely blocked by fallen rock and the south looks almost as bad.</desc>

But as your feet hit the bottom of the hole an eerie light flickers somewhere above you and you find yourself standing in a large cavern. Against the far wall is a rocky shelf with the dessicated remains of what might have once been cloth strewn upon it.  A table in the center of the cavern sits thick with dust except for an almost dust free rectangular space.  Small but fresh looking footprints can be seen on the floor. Whoever was here walked around the room several times and stopped at the table before climbing back up to the tunnel.  A fine sheet of some sort of high tech lies on the floor near the entrance.</desc>

If there is only the slightest chance that he will find our messengers, our children, then perhaps we can make amends.  The labs are shut down now so we can make no more changes.  The race will have to survive as it is.  The power packs are all drained except those in the cryo-bed and the shuttle.  I&apos;m moving from here soon.  I want to spend the last of my days closer to our creation.  I see the companion in each of them.  The droid says it will be more than two thousand years.  Even he will not last that long.

      <name>A Shallow Cave in a Cliff</name>
      <desc>This rocky shelf half way up a towering cliff is not dissimilar to the one at the research station. Grey waves surge and churn below you, throwing salt spray high as they crash against the rocks.  This perch would be quite impossible to reach by foot from the seaward side, and just as impossible to leave that way.  The flitter nestles under an overhang and is therefore protected from view from the cliff top.  For a moment it seems a small patch of the cliff face below you ripples and settles back to stone again.  A narrow slit at the back of the shallow cave looks big enough to squeeze through.</desc>

Two figures move slowly through knee-high maroon vegetation to the west.  The plants grow in fan-shaped dark fleshy curves, similar to some fungi on Earth but much larger.  One figure is that of a male whose hair is a mane of red.  he carries a horn and seems to be engaging in a continual dance of graceful movement while the much smaller figure ladles a thick red-brown liquid from a barrel around the base of each plant. Every ladle full appears to be a ceremony in it&apos;s own right. The boy accidentally strikes the side of the barrel with the ladle and freezes at the hollow clunking sound. A few meters ahead of him the ground begins to ripple. Immediately the man raises the horn to his lips and an ear-shattering note ensues. The mantra flaps awkwardly away and the sound dies. An acrid coppery odor drifts from the barrel.</desc>

In the village, golden tanned people with copper and chestnut hair are going about daily tasks, waving greetings to one another and soundlessly engaging in body-language conversations.  Many of them carry the large horns slung by a cord over one shoulder. Surveying the scene, you notice that nobody looking older than about thirty standard years is in evidence.

The accident took us into a past we cannot escape. We will not exist for over two thousand years. We created progeny from our own cells and those of the companion and changed them to allow them to survive where we cannot.  The pathogen lives in everything here but we increased the resistance enough to allow our progeny to breed.  Now the Mok has taken her. I don&apos;t know where. May he be damned as I am for what I have done. To pass the message through millennia I burdened our children with a saviour who may never come. The plants are the only solution to the nutrition this world lacks. The people must live. The companion must be returned. Forgive me.</desc>
