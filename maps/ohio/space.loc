      <desc>Your sensors are picking up signals from what seems to be an ancient Earth VOR (Voice Omni Radio) and ILS Instrument Landing System. You can&apos;t imagine that anyone would be using such archaic navigational systems and dismiss the signals as the reflection of a late 20th century Earth signal off a far distant planet.  Just then, your comm unit comes to life: &apos;Hey, you coming down here or not?  I&apos;m holding a docking space for you.  So use it or get out of here. I got other guys needin&apos; a place to park!&apos;</desc>
