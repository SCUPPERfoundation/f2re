      <desc>   You find yourself in the middle of a courtyard garden, surrounded by colorful creations of Mother Nature&apos;s design. The aroma immediately captivates you, leaving you with a feeling of serenity as you indulge in the beauty around you. A grouping of iron patio furniture with fluffy cushions provides you with comfortable seating to enjoy the view, while a large umbrella provides you with shade from the sun. Birds flutter around in the trees that surround the courtyard, their soft chirping providing a calming melody. A squirrel is busy gathering food as he scurries across the brick patio on his venture. A cart containing a pitcher of fresh lemonade has been left for your enjoyment.</desc>

As the canoe gets in motion for your return to the Islet, sunset is on the horizon as the Island revolves away from the sun. The sky is laced with bright-colored scarves, and soon the twilit, peach sky becomes a crimson wound.</desc>

The plush carpeting gives the room a crisp soft charm. Along the back wall is a small kitchenette and nestled in a nook through some louver doors is the bathroom. To the left is a grand old mahogany 4-poster bed elegantly outfitted in gossamer laces and linens, and a mahogany armoire with scrolled feet and a carved skirt. A tiffany lamp sits atop a matching bedside table. A ceiling fan centered above the bed turns slowly. To the right is a sitting area where a white marble coffee table is centered between two armchairs in front of a white overstuffed sofa. The room is full of plants of various varieties, including a large bay window seat with ferns draping themselves over the edge of their pots and hanging in the afternoon sun.</desc>

What follows is not so much night, but a lilac afterglow that in a few hours will be the prelude to sunrise.</desc>

A single desk sits in front of a large window, the drapes drawn open, overlooking the northern waters of the ocean. The desk and matching armchairs are made of polished teak wood and intricately carved with jungle plants and animal life, the chairs carved to match with the names of the owners centered in their backs. Ornate rugs cover the floors, and deep comfortable chairs are placed about the room for guests. A portrait hangs on the wall showing Tia and Leo facing each other, each with one hand on a golden goblet looking into each others eyes... a bonding ritual native to the Island. A wetbar against the wall offers libations from all over the universe, as it is customary to seal all business deals with a drink.</desc>

At the back of the Hut is a native woman selling Island trinkets and clothing suitable for the Island and the warm days on Kameo. Dressing booths made of bamboo with cloth draped doors are also provided. To your left is a man sitting behind a long table with radios and equipment you might find useful in exploring the Island. Although a little crowded, it must serve its purpose well as there are so many people milling about and looking at different items for sale here. Perhaps you should have a look as well, or maybe you should venture to the Island instead...</desc>
