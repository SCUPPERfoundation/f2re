      <desc>  This segment is serviced by robotic meddroids whose medical ability is essentially limited to dispensing an occasional analgesic.  Since the vast majority of the work force on Diagaga is robotic, this clinic is actually only provided in order to reduce the liability insurance premiums required to cover those sentient workers who occasionally visit the facility to perform maintenance activities that are beyond the ability of the robotic workers.  There is, however, an automated cloning center, with an associated insurance kiosk, in the event a sentient entity succumbs to the various perils present in the workplace.</desc>

The transparent panels of the dome show the mottled red dwarf star to be the diameter of a dinner plate held at arm&apos;s length.  The star is sufficiently dim to allow viewing without filters, and its surface writhes and bubbles like a witch&apos;s caldron.</desc>

From this vantage point one can observe the mottled surface of the tiny and angry red dwarf that serves as the primary for this system.  The ruddy star is nearly directly overhead and since the asteroid is in a fixed rotation this location is ideal for continuous stellar observations which are conducted in the dome segment to the northeast.</desc>

The telescoping spaceway has small polycarbosilicate windows set in the overlapping panels, which provide a limited, but spectacular view of the surface of the asteroid.  Steep mountains which tower to ridiculous heights in the low gravity surround the spaceport and domes.  The mountains form a nearly impenetrable fortress allowing access to the industrial facility only from space.  Curiously, heavy industrial lasers are mounted around the perimeter of the spaceport, and even more curious they all seem to be aimed spaceward.

The trusses are glassteel with transparent triangular polycarbosilicate panels.  The asteroid is in captive rotation about the Rubble primary red dwarf, resulting in a constant, albeit weak ruddy daylight.

The dianoga is the epitome of garbage scavengers.  Originally, they were large squid-like creatures, growing up to 10 meters and dwelling in swampy regions where carcasses and other debris would collect.  The specimens on Diagaga have been genetically engineered to grow to 20 meters or more, with tentacles over 100 meters long.  They devour garbage at a prodigious rate, and excrete a panoply of pharmaceutical base feedstock chemicals.  The feedstocks are filtered and extracted from the waste water, purified and shipped off-planet to drug production facilities throughout the galaxy.</desc>

The makeup water also contains trace pheromones from the other captive dianoga, which in turn creates a fierce competition in all, as each member attempts to become the largest, and subsequently, the dominant member.  This spurs each to consume at their maximum possible rate.  However, much of the increased bulk goes into tentacle growth in length, mass, and number, which requires constant pruning.  Genetically designed to be extremely efficient processors of biological waste, or what may be more appropriately described as garbage, nearly all of the energy from the mound of organic material goes into creating the pharmaceutical products, subsequently excreted as dianoga waste.</desc>

      <desc>  The inner two thirds of the enormous armored chamber contain an immense chocolate-brown dianoga which smells positively offal.  The creature is dining upon a huge mass of partially rotted guts, entrails, feathers, beaks, bones, claws, heads, hooves, tails, and any manner of slaughterhouse waste that is leftover from the processing of animal proteins for a hungry galaxy.</desc>
      <desc>  Beneath the stench of the offal is the elusive fragrance of chocolate, which is what this behemoth is manufacturing.  The aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons from the disgusting morass presently being devoured are converted into the most addictive compound known to a galaxy full of sentient beings - chocolate!</desc>
      <desc>  The ring of industrial lasers around the landing pad seeks to defend this particular creature alone, as it is the Grand Garbage-to-Gaga-to-Groat generator for this entire operation, creating Fortress Chocolate, indeed!</desc>

      <desc>  The crawl space widens to a large concrete cavern with slimicles hanging from the ceiling, and a pool of fetid water in the center.  To ensure maximum quality control of the garbage being fed to the dianoga, a complex monitoring network of sensors is interlaced throughout the discrete piles.</desc>
      <desc>  The sensors buried in the various piles monitor the temperature, moisture, oxygen and methane contents, and pH, and all lead back to a central processor which is connected to the main control room.  Occasionally, a tiny robotic worker scurries up a probe shaft to repair or replace a worn or damaged sensor.</desc>
      <desc>  The pile is actually subdivided into four quadrants, each with its own specific requirements.  The northern quadrant is general organic waste; the east mostly coffee wastes; the south contains charred tobacco dottle; while the west is partially rendered animal offal from a myriad of galactic abattoirs. Passageways set in the dividing walls lead off in the four diagonal directions.</desc>

      <desc>  The sour smell of spent coffee grounds from Sumatra is overwhelming; however, the immense purple creature in the center of the containment seems to be scooping up from the pile of waste with wild abandon.  This particular dianoga was engineered specifically to convert the caffeine in the spent grounds into synthetic cocaine, as the chemical structures of the two compounds are quite similar.</desc>
      <desc>  Possibly noting the vestigial swimming fins that look like wings, and the single eyestalk that appears to be a horn, some wit has posted a large placard on the glassteel which reads:</desc>

      <desc>  All the constituents that make up the chemical nature of chocolate that are excreted by the dianoga are filtered and separated in this maze of machinery.  Specifically, the faux cocoa solids and faux cocoa butter are the primary products, but a multitude of flavonoids, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, catechins, anthocyanidins and chalcones, not to dismiss theobromide or xantheose, the active constituent, all add to the complex and extremely addictive taste and sensation of chocolate.  The other, somewhat addictive, recreational pharmaceuticals that are manufactured on Diagaga pale in comparison to the addictive nature of chocolate, and as such it commands an enormous price, both on the regular and black markets, as an appreciable amount of product is nicked by thieving robotic stevedores.</desc>

      <desc>  Large electrically driven pumps chug reclaimed water from the Gamma Process, which has been scavenged of all valuable pharmaceutical constituents, into the Beta Containment through large pipes that lead from the southwest to the north.  The makeup water having been purified to near potable quality still contains trace pheromones used by the dianoga to communicate, as a manner of speaking, in dank and turbid waters.  The ambient water concentration of these chemicals is closely monitored, and any excess is extracted, concentrated, and sold as a wildly popular fragrance, with apparent aphrodisiac properties affecting all sexes.</desc>
      <desc>  The &quot;Essence of Noga&quot; is marketed by DBP under the trademarked moniker - Panoge, a subtle parody on its panache origin, as a trace plume of pheromones in the circulating water.</desc>

Though perfectly pristine, the water still carries the tantalizing fragrance of chocolate, and a sidestream is bottled and marketed as &quot;cHoc-2-O&quot;, a popular energy drink.  Apparently, the trace pheromones add to its appeal.</desc>
      <desc>  Water is an essential commodity on Diagaga, and nearly every kilogram must be accounted for.  As such, the circulating water makes a counter-clockwise loop through all four containment chambers, being purified as the manufactured pharmaceutical products in turn are filtered and extracted.  The loop is nearly completely closed-cycle, with only a modest amount of water added by the garbage balanced by the loss to product.  Even the water of combustion of the methane is added back to the process.</desc>

      <name>Dianoga Gamma Containment</name>
      <desc>  The inner half of the glassteel enclosure is occupied by a massive bilious green creature that is devouring mounds of a charred fibrous waste at an incredible rate.  This monster has been genetically altered to consume nicotiana tabacum waste and excrete a plethora of synthetic opiates.  A side effect of the prodigious consumption is the cancerous growth of multiple tentacles, which are constantly sheared off, likely adding to the ill-temper of the dianoga.  The sheared tentacles, entirely composed of edible proteins, are ground into a paste and flash-dried into greenish protein wafers that are sold at cost on the local market.</desc>
      <desc>  Some wit has noted in a scrawl across the containment wall that:</desc>
      <desc>  SOYLENT GREEN IS NOT PEOPLE! IT&apos;S DIA-CA-CA!</desc>
      <desc>The statement, though mildly humorous, is not entirely correct.  The green protein wafers are merely a byproduct, while the dianoga waste is the lucrative main product and substantially more valuable.</desc>

Boxes of vials and bales of bundles of a multitude of opiates, including; codeine, morphine, procaine, xylocaine, and a blizzard of other derivatives, are packaged and trundled off to the spaceport for trans-shipment.  Of course, none of these pharmaceuticals appear on the local market, and one needs very good contacts simply to get on the bidder&apos;s list.</desc>
