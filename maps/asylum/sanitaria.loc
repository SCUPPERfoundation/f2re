      <desc>&quot;Not my happy place... Not my happy place...&quot; You open your eyes and find yourself lying on a bed in a small but comfortable white room. You bring your head up off the pillow and observe several other small rooms containing well dressed individuals who look very uptight being hugged firmly by friendly whitecoats. A whitecoat notices that you&apos;ve come to and immediately wraps you up in a hug. &quot;There there, sir.&quot; She says, &quot;It&apos;s all over now. You&apos;re safe in the holding cells.&quot; She holds you for quite some time, encouraging you to let it all out, before she finally lets you go and hands you a document certifying your sanity and worth.

Here patients are administered electric shocks of varying amplitudes in an effort to realign some of those misplaced neurons. Or whatever. However shock is not limited to electricity here. Several whitecoats are running around the room, dashing up to people and yelling, &quot;Boo!&quot; Occasionally cold water is tossed on a patient, or they are forced to see a scary scene from a movie, or their feet are tickled.

At one desk you see a planet owner in tears, at another a Technocrat incessantly chirping like a bird, and at still another a Mogul smoking his lawyer&apos;s necktie.

You&apos;re rich enough to be in here, so maybe you&apos;re rich enough to afford an appointment with one of the universe&apos;s great psychologists. Or maybe you snuck in here and are about to be thrown back in with the rest of the lowlifes.

Occasionally a whitecoat will quickly push a cart out to the eastern hallway and disappear amongst the throng in that direction. A very wide staircase here has been divided into lanes for walking up, walking down, running up, running down and, oddly enough, falling up and down.

A fairly well-to-do looking lobster chimes in &quot;Happens to the best of us.&quot; You struggle to your feet and head east towards the only exit. &quot;Whoa, you can&apos;t open that!&quot; an enormous, cyclopean monstrosity says. &quot;Can&apos;t you hear what&apos;s out there?&quot; Indeed, the whole room is filled with disturbing screams and shrieks from outside, but there is no other way out...</desc>

      <desc>The walls feel like they are closing in on you as you walk down this interminably long, narrow hallway. Scratches decorate every wall and inmates push past you, hurrying through the area as though there were some important place that they absolutely had to be soon. You&apos;re certain that some of these were former Captains, Adventurers and Traders driven mad by the endless tasks they were forced to perform for minimal reward.</desc>

      <desc>Surprisingly situated within the Asylum, Loon&apos;s Refuge was once the facility&apos;s cafeteria, but was taken over by the inmates and now serves as a tavern and diner for the denizens of this madhouse. The place is packed with creatures of every size, shape and grasp on reality. A bard on a raised platform blows forcefully into a bedpan and though it produces no sound several inmates are dancing on a cleared floor before him. The floor, tables, walls and even ceiling are coated in a thick, unappetizing grime. Fires have been started around the room and some inmates are cooking over them, their light oddly off-setting the flickering fixtures above. Despite the overall grodiness of the joint the food does actually smell very good, and any alcohol that leaves so dedicated a mark in the floor must be worth drinking.</desc>

Suddenly everyone in the queue is jumping up and down in unison, slamming into one another and thrashing about roughly in time with the music. The clerks at the front dance lewdly in their cages as undergarments are hurled at them from various points in the room. You leap up above the fray and crowd surf along, yelling and shouting with abandon before getting dropped right in front of the clerks. Abruptly the music stops, the lights come on, and everything is precisely as it was. The clerk before you, her hair in a tight bun, checks your papers, stamps your hand and waves you past.

How in the world did you get so high?! Yellow clouds whip past you as you plummet, when suddenly you are shaken hard. You crash through a flimsy roof, through a flimsy floor, and land on an enormous metal bell, which tolls out a loud, low note. Your ears ring as you slide down to the floor, rub your head and catch your breath. Bats, apparently startled by the commotion, fly panic-stricken around the room, brushing against you and filling your ears with a frantic pulsing noise. It appears that you are high, high up in Areinay Chapel&apos;s belfry. The situation does not look good, however, as there are no immediately apparent exits save for a hole in the floor with a rope attached to the bell.

Highly efficient Sanitaria work-release inmates gather up your molecules and bury them in a nice plot in the graveyard. All that remains is a pile of dust, your left eye, and a bit of finger. When your eye adjusts to the gloom of the grave, you use your bit of finger to start piecing yourself back together. Molecule by molecule your finger painstakingly reassembles your individual atoms until at long last you have been put back together, though you can&apos;t help but feel shorter. The effort took you a very long time, though, and you don&apos;t have much air left. You&apos;d better get out of this grave.</desc>

It looks and smells delicious and you attack it with a gusto! Interestingly this is usually how you eat. No sooner to you consume the food than you start to feel... funny. Really funny, actually. Not &quot;ha ha&quot; funny either, more like &quot;I think my head isn&apos;t connected to my body anymore&quot; funny. The walls start melting and you feel weightless, like you&apos;re floating upward, as you lose consciousness.</desc>

      <desc>Desperate to escape the Asylum, you eye a suspiciously solid looking wall. It&apos;s too solid to actually be there, you reason. It must be a clever trick by the administrators of this place! But you&apos;re not crazy! You&apos;re too smart for them! So you get a running start and take off sprinting for that fake wall. There is a brief moment of pain upon impact and then...</desc>
      <desc>   The walls around you warp and twist. The faces of the people in the hall rearrange themselves, go blank, or take on a startling resemblance to Leonard Nimoy. The doors tell you to assassinate various political leaders in order to gain the attention of celebrities. You feel an intense physical attraction to the Prime Minister of England and start crying that your parents did not name you Billy-boy. You can feel yourself slipping into unconsciousness, and are filled with the overwhelming desire to flee, anywhere, before you descend completely into madness.</desc>

      <name>Sanity&apos;s Wake Hospital</name>
      <desc>As soon as you walk through the door, a medical professional is at your arm, speeding you through the sign-in and into a waiting room. You marvel at the efficiency of the place, as it&apos;s far beyond any system you&apos;ve encountered, though also very chaotic. Of course, the Asylum&apos;s hospital handles more cases than almost any other hospital in the galaxy, with a wider range of problems than most any other. Rookies sent to a posting here leave seasoned veterans, and anyone who has done a stint as an Asylum doctor is immediately afforded the respect of his peers. Yet, despite all this, as you watch the doctors literally sprint from room to room, the position hardly seems enviable.</desc>
      <desc>   If you&apos;re going to explore the dangerous Asylum, you&apos;d better insure. When you&apos;re covered head southeast and make the doctors&apos; lives easier.</desc>

      <desc>The gates to the famous Asylum stand tall and imposing across the courtyard from you. Once again you are struck with wonder as to why this location was selected to build the galaxy&apos;s most prominent psychiatric and psychological research facilities, as the building and planet do not at all seem conducive to sanity. Miles above your head a massive metal ring slowly turns, attracting the constant electrical activity in the atmosphere and periodically blasting down a massive discharge of energy, which strikes the topmost spire of Asylum with a thunderous crack. The gate itself is held shut by five massive statues labeled &quot;Jessecka, Ferreri, Djentsch, Sleeperagent and Pianoman.&quot; The one labeled Djentsch wields a gigantic I-beam which bars the gates securely. On the other side of the gate a smaller statue of a monkey appears to struggle to get out. Oil is pumped through the creases in this smallest statue and lit so that it is perpetually wreathed in dancing flames.</desc>

In the flickering dim you can see the oil running down canals in the walls, or glistening up transparent tubing to fuel lights. A band is playing on a floating platform and the music is mellow but cheerful. Virtually every surface in the room is padded excessively with dark cushions and you can&apos;t help but chuckle at the irony of a padded lounge on a planet named Asylum. Still, considering the chaos outside you couldn&apos;t ask for a better environment.</desc>

As you set the pen down her hand darts out and grabs you gently but insistently. &quot;I think I have... a special job for you.&quot; The other inmates in the room groan and complain as you shoot them a triumphant grin. The receptionist escorts you to a large service elevator. She pushes a button and immediately you feel like you weigh ten times more. The elevator rockets up the shaft before stopping abruptly. The receptionist smiles at you, hands you a tool that looks like a gardening spade with a bucket attached, and gives you a hard push on the back, forcing you out of the car to the north. Before you can ask her what you&apos;re supposed to do the door closes and the car disappears, rocketing downward and almost making you glad you are no longer on it.</desc>

      <desc>As you approach you wonder whether you&apos;ve made a wrong turn. The scarecrow indicated this was a garden but all you&apos;ve found is a vast cemetary. However, as you read the inscription &quot;Kirkegard&quot; on the large wrought iron gates it suddenly makes sense: &quot;church garden.&quot; If it were silent and empty this area would be beautiful, it is well landscaped and attractively laid out. However there is a din of wailing in the air and crowds of mourners shrieking at the sides of some tombs. Safer lunatics from the Asylum are allowed to tend the grounds here and there is only minimal supervision from the whitecoats, which also does not help set your mind at ease while standing surrounded by tombstones and markers. Three ancient men sit quietly on headstones and snore. East will take you back under the wrought iron gates and out to the plaza.</desc>

      <desc>Finally you aren&apos;t being pushed about by the surge of the crowd! The plaza is actually fairly open, though large groups of people still move about. A gigantic scarecrow stands next to a dark fountain in the center of the area. It has dozens of arms, each supporting a small, dangling sign and pointing in a different direction. You expect that once this scarecrow only had a few arms and made the plaza look somewhat charming but as more locations have been added the scarecrow has become increasingly unsettling in appearance. Examining its arms carefully you deduce that there is a bar to the northeast, a trading exchange to the southeast, a shipyard to the southwest, a sanctuary to the east, a hospital to the northwest, and a restaurant to the west. South will get you back to the Landing Pad and north will take you to the gates of the Asylum.</desc>

      <desc>In the midst of the chaos surrounding the Asylum rests Areinay Chapel, and it is an unusual sight indeed. The yellow clouds that cover the rest of the planet are gone when you look up and replaced by a circle of perfectly blue sky. The churchyard maintains a small plot of grass despite the rocky ground and a pair of living trees out front. An elderly cleric is watering some smaller plants, and looks up at you with a friendly smile. You feel simultaneously relieved and horrified by this slice of sanity in a mad world.</desc>

In fact, from in here you would think you were standing in a full-blown cathedral, not some little chapel tended by a single cleric. There are a few people quietly occupying the mostly empty pews, moving their lips silently or paging through intimidating-looking books. A massive pipe-organ occupies the front of the church along with an altar and a huge table of candles, many of which are lit. Once you feel fortified and refreshed, you can leave by heading west.</desc>

You are checked for weapons, you are made to certify that you are not an inmate, you are required to show your licenses, permits, birth certificate, and take an inkblot test. Finally you are escorted into a spacious, well-kept, and mercifully air-conditioned room with small holographic models of various spacecraft set on pedestals. A large window bay overlooks the most secure ship-manufacturing facility this side of Sol, with ten whitecoats to every worker there. A smiling female whitecoat asks you in a soothing voice if she can help you make a decision on a ship today.</desc>

They are polite when approached or questioned, but bear about them an extremely stern countenance. A massive crowd presses in on a plain building labeled &quot;Government Works,&quot; and you break into a sweat thinking that you might have to try and get through there. Thankfully a white coated man approaches you and says that unless you&apos;re planning on mingling with inmates, need to pay royalties or settle a fine, you can bypass customs and simply enter the facility. He gestures north to an open guardhouse which you can pass straight through. Of course, if you want you can head into the Bureau of Bureaucracy and face the mob.</desc>

There is ticker tape spewing out of randomly placed and angled slots in the walls, floating down and landing on a mass of people shrieking and bartering with one another. Multiple screens display information on goods in no particular order, and trying to follow along with the whole mess is an exercise in mental discipline and control. Adding to the chaos is the army of poorly maintained waitdroids attempting to move drinks and food through the mob of people, frequently spilling or comically unloading the contents of their trays onto aggressive brokers.</desc>
      <desc>   As a courtesy, a large window has been provided overlooking a cliff, and traders who have lost everything are invited to throw themselves out and end it all right now. A sign advertising this service reads, &quot;Why wait? Defenestrate!&quot;</desc>

Occasionally the yellow clouds disperse enough to reveal the source of these lights: the famous (if unimaginatively named) Asylum. The building itself resembles the castle of some fictional arch-tyrant. Gargoyles of all shapes and sizes watch shuttles descend past tall, narrow towers and long, sweeping bridges. This planet is renowned for caring for the mentally ill, and yet the entire place is less conducive to sanity than anywhere you have ever seen. Above you the clouds swirl and twist at dramatic speeds and electricity crackles about the atmosphere. Other ships are landing haphazardly everywhere, including one labeled &quot;Bubba&quot; that just seems to land and take off repeatedly in a cordoned area, so it would likely be best for you to move north if you plan on continuing your observation as a living creature.</desc>
