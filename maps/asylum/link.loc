      <name>Ooooohhhhhh, A Secret Room!</name>
      <desc>You&apos;ll find these secret rooms scattered all over the planets in the Asylum system. Actually, every single planet makes maximum use of the allotted number of locations, so if you haven&apos;t found 77 on Sanitaria, 49 on Narcissus and 49 here you&apos;re missing something. Not to worry, though: a friendly bribe of a slithy or two to Mono might reveal the missing locations. As for this secret room, it&apos;s like most of the rest: luxurious, comfortable, offering full drinks and food, and well connected to the rest of the planet. If you&apos;re looking for a nice place to hang out where you won&apos;t be bothered, well, it&apos;s hard to beat these secret rooms!</desc>
      <desc>In will take you back to the Hall of Memories</desc>

Doctors surround you and inform you that you do not have the security clearance necessary to be poking around these parts of the asteroid. They ask you how you would feel if the asteroid went poking around inside of YOU without permission. With that they inject you with some strange substance and haul you to a wastechute. It spits you OUT onto the Landing Pad... But they forgot to take away your official Monodefuego Fan Club button! Looks like you&apos;ll be able to get back onto the asteroid once again... Only question is what was that stuff they injected you with?</desc>

      <desc>Moving quietly through the darkened tunnel you can hear the sound of machinery whirring up ahead, punctuated frequently by the loud, bursting noise of a ship emerging from or entering into the interstellar link attached to the asteroid. This tunnel is definitely getting narrower as you progress, but up ahead it terminates at a creeky-looking wooden door, complete with light shining through the cracks and openings. Some conventions are just too interesting to overturn. Anyway the door is north or you can head back to the tunnel&apos;s entrance to the south.</desc>

      <name>Inside the Firemonkey Creation Chamber</name>
      <desc>So, you decided you want to be a Firemonkey? Alright! You hop into the cylinder on the far side of the lab and are automatically strapped in. The next hour is the most unpleasant of your entire life. Burning hot ooze pours over you body, occasionally causing your skin (or equivalent packaging) to erupt into flames. Pressure builds painfully through the area and you are tweaked, poked, prodded and twisted inside the machine. You can even feel your personality twist, you feel a little more... free, perhaps? Psychotic, maybe? And you note a definite increase in your desire to dominate all things and, as an aside, see what they look like when they burn. You feel simultaneously cuddly and prickly, friendly and cruel, you are a mix of all things and as you are popped out of the chamber and take a gander of your new, firey form in the mirror you understand what it truly means to be a firemonkey. Head out and enjoy your new life in a new body!</desc>

The teleportation matrix effectively shuts down all teleportation traffic to all points except the Landing Pad. It must be a precaution to keep anyone from poking their nose around here when they aren&apos;t welcome. If you&apos;re feeling brave you can head in a small door on the matrix itself, though the way electricity zaps around the device you&apos;re not certain that&apos;s a good idea. Otherwise you can head southeast back along the machines.</desc>

      <desc>The tunnel ends here... well kind of anyway. It tapers to an end and towards the point is a small metal grate. Looking down through it you can see a room which emits the screeching grumble of machinery. Bright lights shine and you can just make out some pistons battering away. Observing the grate you could almost certainly force it open and drop down into the room below. Otherwise the tunnel stretches east.</desc>

      <name>The Firemonkey Lab</name>
      <desc>Passing through a sliding door you enter into the most elaborate of all the laboratories on the Link, the firemonkey lab. Here, via a complicated process known only to Monodefuego and his top engineers, firemonkeys are &quot;birthed&quot; in a small, portholed, cylindrical compression chamber on the far side of this darkened room. Tanks of chemicals, tubes funneling genetic ooze, large electric capacitors and the disturbing presence of barrels of old fashioned black powder surround the compression chamber and machinery constantly whirs and sputters. Apparently they&apos;re pretty proud of the process, since everything here is on display, but it&apos;s more than a little unnerving. It also begs the question: if Monodefuego invented this process, and HE&apos;S a firemonkey... Where did he come from?</desc>
      <desc>Ponder the imponderable, have a drink of the stuff they&apos;re serving at the bar, then head southwest.</desc>

They whir, grind and clatter alarmingly but hold together, working on whatever they&apos;re working on. One thing you&apos;re sure of, the other interstellar links don&apos;t seem to require this much machinery.</desc>

Arrayed in front of you are a large number of machines, whirring noisily and performing some unknown purpose, maybe purifying the air, maybe purifying the water... Of course that doesn&apos;t exactly explain the green goo pumping through the clear tubes running southward. If you stay close to the wall, you can head west along the machines, otherwise a walkway provides you with access to the south.</desc>

Something&apos;s wrong, the entryway that you came into this stairwell through is gone! You search frantically along the walls, but no luck. Oddly, however, the stairway doesn&apos;t seem to terminate anywhere, it just stretches down forever. You can keep walking down and try to find the bottom, or you can head back up and make up your own mind as to which direction you think you should go in the tunnels above.</desc>

He says he knows a way to bypass the security forces that bar passage past the heavily fortified doors behind the bulkhead. He pushes aside a bookcase to reveal a set of stairs and says that if you head up you&apos;ll find a tunnel that will take you around the defenses so you can find out what&apos;s going on. You turn to ask him what&apos;s in it for him but he&apos;s already disappeared!</desc>

The light on the airlock is green, apparently indicating it&apos;s safe to go out... And after all the Landing Pad was in the open, exposed air of the asteroid... So maybe it&apos;s ok? If you&apos;re not willing to take your life into your hands just to see what this machinery is doing you can head north. Otherwise the airlock is to the south.</desc>

It would probably be a bad idea to start anything with these guys, and a worse idea to try and get through that door, so you&apos;d be best off turning around and heading to the southeast.

This place is pretty shady, with unsavory-looking individuals ranging from scientists to doctors to smugglers to pirates to all manner of unscrupulous individual working out deals in the quiet booths around this tavern. The cheerful &quot;Monodefuego Fan Club&quot; buttons don&apos;t do much to improve their cutthroat appearances. You hear the din of conversation but can&apos;t make out any individual voices, realizing eventually that the &quot;music&quot; being played over the speakers is actually crowd noise, meant to drown out any private discussions taking place here. This would probably be a good place to conduct some business with some of your less morally robust friends and have a drink of something unspeakably strong.</desc>

However taking a look around you can&apos;t help but notice that some of the sculptures are, well, odd to say the least. One of them, standing a good fifteen feet tall, is of an enormous white chicken with a halo and a placid look. Another looks like a bathtub-sized mug of coffee, but a hand sticks awkwardly out of the handle and clutches a gun. Must be some sort of art nouveu.</desc>
      <desc>When you&apos;re done appreciating the artwork the hallway continues to the northeast, you can head back to the main plaza of the secret city to the southwest, or you can head in and visit the Hall of Memories. See what an advantage you get just by reading the room descriptions?</desc>

He notices a small, extinguished patch on your knee shakes his head sadly. &quot;Sorry amigo,&quot; says the inspector, doing a reasonable firemonkey impersonation, &quot;The process is still being tweaked, we haven&apos;t had a single perfect specimen pop out yet and the boss has been very specific: if they aren&apos;t as perfect as he is, they go into the garbage disposal.&quot; He pulls a lever, the doors slam shut with a bang, the lights burn red and the word &quot;Rejected&quot; appears all over the room. Underneath you the floor gives way and you fall down a chute. As you tumble you are periodically seized by machines, stretched, blasted with cold chemicals, twisted and pulled. Finally you land with a crash, very much yourself... Except for the spot they missed: you can flick your thumb on fire like a lighter! Enjoy the new power and head southwest.</desc>

The link itself is discretely hooked to the machinery that you saw inside the asteroid. Every time a ship passes through the link, either coming or going, just as it enters hyperspace the link does... something... to the ship. Tags it somehow or plants something on it. Suddenly it all becomes clear, the link has been tampered with in order to conduct some massive, intergalactic genetic experiment. A tiny plaque is embedded in the rock reads, &quot;I know what you&apos;re thinking. I promise, it&apos;ll mean big bucks for you. Yours, Monodefuego&quot;.

Some of them boast about the superiority of their ships and the special modifications they have implemented in order to beat customs in sol, or complete complicated trading runs in ludicrously short amounts of time. If you like you can trick out your ride here as well, some of the galaxy&apos;s best maverick grease monkeys are available to equip you with some nasty looking weapons, some blazingly fast engine and power supply packages, or reams of radar-resistant, high impact armor. If you&apos;ve just gotten into a scrape with customs or a ship that didn&apos;t want to share its goods with you, you can get your craft repaired here as well.</desc>

      <desc>This area is filled with scientists, shady-looking traders, ruffians, militia, whitecoats, and bureaucrats all quietly attending to their own business. Harsh halogen lights flicker around this cavernous, largely undecorated central plaza for this city which, by all accounts, really shouldn&apos;t be here. Rising above the hushed sound of the considerable foot traffic here is the low electrical noise of generators and air pumps and the occasional crackle and roar of a ship passing through the link just outside the ceiling of this cavern, an event which causes the entire asteroid to shake.</desc>
      <desc>An airlock to the south will take you back outside to the open air exchange. All other services are located within the asteroid. There is a shipyard to the west, a hospital to the east and a dark tavern to the north. A hall extends to the northeast and a secured bulkhead is to the northwest.</desc>

Of course, before going through any procedure of that nature you should purchase insurance, which is helpfully sold here as well.</desc>

You only make it about four steps into the room before one of them yells &quot;Halt!&quot; Of course, before the word even finishes escaping his lips four or five of them are on top of you. They pummel you within an inch of your life... then they go another twenty or thirty yards.</desc>
      <desc>You awaken not in heaven (or its alternative) but inside a hospital room. Apparently being an official Monodefuego Fan Club member has perks, they put you back together for free! Unfortunately it also has drawbacks and, as this is a biological asteroid, they performed genetic experiments on you while they patched you up. What they could be trying to discover by giving you two bellybuttons is anybody&apos;s guess, though. But you&apos;re feeling fine and set to go out the exit to the west.</desc>

Looking up you can make out Sanitaria and the small glimmer of light that is Narcissus on the far side of the system. Unlike the noisy areas you&apos;ve been in up to now this room is heavily soundproofed so the effect is less like watching a demolition derby and more like watching a chaotic, beautiful space ballet. The bar is virtually empty and there&apos;s nobody here checking credentials anyway, if you made it this far in they just sort of figure you belong, so plop down and have a drink and relax. When you&apos;re ready to leave you can head down and go back to the Event Horizon itself or head out to a shuttle which will take you to the Landing Pad.</desc>

This is the first link with a landing pad you&apos;ve ever encountered, but apart from the small, blinking lights marking the spot there doesn&apos;t appear to be anything remarkable about the area, or any reason to wish to land here. Only a few hundred feet away shines the distorted portal of the interstellar link, which emits a hissing roar of energy and a shower of sparks every time a ship passes through.</desc>
      <desc>Your only company here is a guard to the east, sitting in an uncomfortable-looking, folding metal chair. He watches you intently over the top of a book entitled &quot;A Firemonkey&apos;s Friend: the Starter Guide&quot;, scanning your body like he&apos;s looking for something.</desc>

      <name>Link Exchange</name>
      <desc>Stars whirl past overhead at this large, exposed exchange on the surface of the asteroid. A number of shady-looking traders (each of them wearing their &quot;Monodefuego Fan Club&quot; buttons) bustle about the area, buying and selling huge quantities of goods which move through a large set of bay doors to the south. The prices here are amazing and nobody seems to have any scruples about trading just about anything. This is a great place to make a few bucks.</desc>
      <desc>To the north there is a set of metal doors on the side of a large, rocky outcropping of the asteroid.</desc>

Of course, before going through any procedure of that nature you should purchase insurance, which is helpfully sold here as well.</desc>

Actually it killed you, but you were the fortunate owner of an official Monodefuego Fan Club button, entitling you to free resurrection here on this quiet little asteroid. No need for the insurance companies to get involved... Frankly they don&apos;t even know about the existence of this little operation. Good news for your wallet, bad news for your kidneys which seem to be missing. They&apos;ve been replaced, apparently, since you&apos;re not dead.</desc>

      <desc>You clever explorer! You managed to find another height of oppulence: the REALLY secret room! Every Asylum system planet has at least two of these. Be pleased with yourself! And, while you enjoy a pat on the back, take advantage of everything that Mono&apos;s finest personal facilities have to offer. For one you can consume all manner of biologically engineered, performance enhancing foods. Have a drink and relax on the huge, white couches that lie about the room and watch Mono&apos;s minions run around on the dozens of screens that monitor the Link&apos;s activity. Finally, held shrine-like in the center of the room is Mono&apos;s Plan A: A metal book of 5,617 steps for cosmic domination. Feel free to browse, brave explorer. Browse... and despair. When you&apos;ve had your fill relaxing you can go...</desc>

      <name>Monodefuego&apos;s Interstellar Link Throne Room</name>
      <desc>This room is optimally positioned to watch the coming and going of the space traffic from the interstellar link. A giant, transparent bubble, it provides a full view of the ships, the system itself (along with the two other planets, Sanitaria hanging nearby and Narcissus a faint gleam in the distance) and the nefarious experiments which take place on each passing ship, unbeknownst to their owners. The room itself is fairly oppulent, dark to take advantage of the overhead starscape and featuring a large, reclining throne directly in the center of the room, set on machinery which can turn and tilt it in any direction at the press of a button. Also, as one would expect, the owner of this facility has provided himself with a generous supply of alcohol. Of course, who ever said no to wine and stargazing?</desc>

      <name>Distortion Chamber</name>
      <desc>The link is bigger on the inside than it is outside. This is, of course, impossible, but how else would you be able to fit shuttles, machinery, goo and enormous quantities of goods here on an interstellar link? That is why one of the first successful secret projects to take place was the creation of the distortion chamber, one part Cloaking Device, one part Pratchett Logic and one part Improbability Drive. The device, which requires huge amounts of power, generates a field inside the link which distorts space and time, making the inside dramatically larger than the outside. Finding yourself skeptical? Well you were willing to suspend disbelief for a talking firemonkey bent on cosmic conquest who flies through space trading furs on distant planets! Get your beliefs consistent and then head east.</desc>

      <desc>Many of the goods bought and sold on the exchange pad are brought here to be processed. Powerpacks energize droids bustling around, checking alloys and polymers and moving them into place. Controllers monitor Tquark lines being laid at an astronomical rate. Sensamps are being cuddled. Woods are being carved into attractive furniture. LanzariK is doing... whatever it is that LanzariK does. But most strangely almost all of the agri products are being made into a kind of slimy soup, cut with monos, antimatter and a mish mash of other stuff. It doesn&apos;t look wonderful, and it smells considerably worse. You feel ill when you see a shipment labelled &quot;Furs and Meat&quot; dump a load of bears into the goo. You can sit around watching the show, or you can head down the hall to the west or east. Your call. One piece of advice: don&apos;t lick anything here.</desc>

Their destinations aren&apos;t labelled with rooms, but rather coded in lengthy numerical sequences, frustrating any attempts to decipher where they are ultimately bound. Large hoverlifts crisscross the area carrying impossibly heavy loads and, as you might expect at a secret facility&apos;s loading and offloading area, there isn&apos;t much concern for personal safety.</desc>

This one is the big, hairy kind. Seriously, it looks like someone opened up the gorilla exhibit and gave this one a &quot;Monodefuego Fan Club&quot; button and a flannel shirt.

And once again are simply not educated enough to understand the processes. Suddenly you become aware the room has gotten very quiet. You turn around slowly to see every scientist in the area staring at you with a sort of eerie smile. &quot;Don&apos;t worry,&quot; one of them says, &quot;You can still help.&quot; Immediately they seize upon you and spend the next three hours injecting you with serums, fortifying your bones with adamantine bands, checking your reaction to super-soldier enhancements and generally messing with your body and head. When they&apos;re done you can head OUT. Are those CLAWS under your wrists? Hrm, wonder how you get those to come out.</desc>
