      <desc>Contrary to the title, there is no store in this room. As a matter of fact it&apos;s just a large, empty bit with nothing interesting to mark it whatsoever, not even a lousy freakin&apos; door. One waitdroid stands sadly in the center of the room holding a dusty tray with an ancient drink sitting on it, but he hasn&apos;t had any company since he was built into this building with no access. As a matter of fact, access is SO limited here that nobody will ever see what was written here, and yet this planet&apos;s author has wasted the few minutes it takes to write up a witty room description. Such is the madness of the Asylum system and its founder Monodefuego.</desc>

      <desc>Decoder Rings for EVERYBODY! People outfitted with insane amounts of Monodefuego merchandise, some of it meticulously crafted by its owners, much of it purchased at the Narcissus Gift Shop, mill about here talking about the ins and outs of galactic conquest, strategy and management. A group of children rehearses a song about peace, unity and setting things randomly on fire.</desc>
      <desc>You receive your first orders: You are now permitted access to the secret project taking place on the Interstellar Link in the Asylum system. Commence aggressive trading on it to further Monodefuego&apos;s plans.</desc>
      <desc>When you&apos;ve finished studying your orders you can get IN a bus and head to Monodefuego&apos;s Headquarters.</desc>

      <name>Voluntary Submission Application Accepted!</name>
      <desc>Congratulations! As you finishing signing your name to the voluntary submission forms you are officially enrolled in the Monodefuego retraining program. You are escorted into the elite chambers of the lucky few, the intelligent few, who acknowledge the hopelessness of resisting the firemonkey&apos;s schemes and have instead decided to go along with him, hoping to reap the benefits of his generosity. The room you are escorted into is covered in posters which feature Mono himself pointing and saying something motivational like, &quot;I want YOU to play Fed 2!&quot; or &quot;Firemonkey is Watching...&quot; But it&apos;s all right, everything is all right, the struggle is finished. You have won the victory over yourself. You love Monodefuego. The only way to go is the way he tells you to, and it&apos;s to the north.</desc>

      <name>Thought Reform Program</name>
      <desc>Congratulations and welcome to your new life! By your new life, we of course mean OUR new life, since yours now belongs to us! For the next several weeks you will be turned into a brand new person through a carefully regimented system of verbal abuse, lengthy seminars, isolation, nutrient deprivation, neurological inhibitors and a variety of other tried and tested methods to render you a loyal, capable, hard-working tool of Monodefuego.</desc>
      <desc>You&apos;re in the program for what seems like ages, by the end you&apos;re thin, tough and utterly incapable of thoughts not given to you by Monodefuego. Just what every little child dreams of growing up to become! Your first assignments will be supervising some janitorial workers at headquarters, so feel free to... oh, excuse us.... DON&apos;T feel free, but you are at leave to explore the facilities. Just head OUT to the shuttle and we&apos;ll drop you off where you&apos;ll be working.</desc>

      <desc>Posters on every wall depict happily drooling zombies, eagerly attending lectures on the greatness of their master Monodefuego, eating nutrient-free gruel, slavishly laboring in beautiful fields and discovering true love in their forced marriages, arranged for their convenience with no impact on their work. All this can be yours through an aggressive program of what is nicely called &quot;Thought Reform&quot; but what is more popularly known as &quot;brainwashing&quot;. You&apos;d think that they would want to hide this fact, but not at all. Several posters even show happily smiling folks having their brains cleaned thoroughly with tooth brushes and little slogans read, &quot;Brain Cleanliness is Next To Godliness!&quot; It seems unusual, but really, doesn&apos;t everyone want to fit in, be popular and equal with their circle of friends, and, through hard work, have the opportunity for safe and controlled advancement? If this is your cup of tea, enroll IN the program, otherwise go southeast.</desc>

      <desc>This looks like a preferable decision to any of the others, certainly. The room is extremely comfortable, with dozens of intelligent-looking, attractive people chatting on long sofas while be waited on by bustling waitdroids. A desk at the front of the room is taking applications to voluntarily join Monodefuego&apos;s growing army of loyal, unquestioning subjects. The ones here seem to have their wills still mostly intact, it might be a good option before someone notices all that free thinking you&apos;re doing. You can enroll IN the program, or head south to choose a more brutal form of compliance. No accounting for taste, after all.</desc>

      <name>Brutal Subjugation</name>
      <desc>Are you kidding me? You voluntarily enrolled in the brutal subjugation program? Maybe you should be spending time on planet Sanitaria instead! The pretty receptionist smiles cruelly as the guards suddenly turn and clamp shackles on your feet. They grab you by the hair and drag you from the room. Suddenly you&apos;re being fitted in a nondescript, grey coverall and equipped with a pick axe. Along with many other, similarly dressed individuals you are forced into a large transport, the doors shut and you feel the surge of acceleration. On board you are instructed that you will be performing janitorial duties at headquarters, disobedience will be severely punished. The quarters are tight and it&apos;s difficult to breathe, but just when you feel you are about to pass out the doors to the west open and you hear shouting from outside commanding you to leave. At this point you don&apos;t have it left in you to resist, head WEST.</desc>

Two guards mull around, talking to each other and casting the occasional, flirty glance at a receptionist on the far side of the room. Her appearance is pleasant enough, with hair tightly pulled back into a bun. The only thing on the desk in front of her is an enrollment form. Elevator music wafts quietly through the room, but despite the benign atmosphere, or maybe because of it, you have a very uneasy feeling. You can head to the desk and enroll IN the program if you like and you&apos;re totally out of your mind, or you can take the exit to the east.</desc>

      <desc>Over the course of your life you&apos;ve picked up all sorts of nasty habits to your thought processes. Things like independence, self-ambition, and odd notions that you shouldn&apos;t be a loyal slave to a burning monkey. Not to worry though, all of those unhealthy problems of free will can be taken care of here, at Monodefuego&apos;s Re-Education Center. A variety of different program choices are available. To the west is a room labeled &quot;Brutal Subjugation&quot;, to the northwest &quot;Thought Reform&quot;, to the east &quot;hypnosis&quot; and to the north, &quot;Voluntary Surrender of the Will&quot;. With so many selections it&apos;s like a fast food restaurant, only instead of getting a hamburger you are stripped of your capacity for independent thought. The entrance to the south has been blocked off by guards wearing oversized firemonkey outfits, their comic appearance uncomfortably offsetting the enormous weapons they carry.</desc>

      <desc>Blank stares attend you as you enter into the hypnosis room. This completely white room is garishly lit by overhead halogens; it actually hurts your eyes a little to be in here. Throughout the area glazed-over individuals carry drinks to amiable-looking, intelligent people wearing sunglasses and holding conversations around the room. A white desk on the far side of the room has a schedule on it, allowing you to enroll IN the hypnosis program, which appears to be a very effective one indeed. If this course of study isn&apos;t the one for you, you can head out the white door to the west and select something else, otherwise sign up and come on IN!</desc>

      <desc>You sign your name on the form and the lights suddenly go out. The sound of ticking clocks surrounds you as the people in the room remove their glasses and stare into your eyes. You wish you could run out, but you can&apos;t see the door and, more disturbingly, you can&apos;t seem to move your legs. You look down, they aren&apos;t shackled or bound, they simply won&apos;t respond when you tell them to move. The hypnotists set you gently onto a chair as whirlidoos and spinny things are illuminated in dim colors on the wall making you feel very unusual... emotionally vulnerable perhaps. A high pitched whine begins to emanate from the loudspeakers and you are told to relax. To your surprise you obey. You are told to sleep, and to your surprise you do. You are told that you are rising above your body, and to your surprise you do indeed begin to float UP.</desc>

      <desc>You wake up surrounded by the people wearing sunglasses. You demand to know what happened and, stifling smiles, they say, &quot;Oh, you were far, far too strong-willed for us to hypnotize! I guess we&apos;ll just have to turn you out for now, but thank you for your interest in our program. Maybe we&apos;ll... contact you sometime. Keep your comm on. In the meantime, try and explore as much of the galaxy as you can... Get to know some important people.&quot; Some of them can barely contain their amusement, and you wonder what they&apos;ve done. As you walk over to the eastern door one of them fakes a sneeze. You wake up again on the floor with all of the hypnotists screaming with maniacal laughter. While they&apos;re distracted you&apos;d better hit that door to the east.</desc>

The most popular design, as you may have guessed, are the flames. Several haulers go in for the silhouette of a sexy, female firemonkey and many of Mono&apos;s personal fleet are outfitted with images of the firemonkey himself. Detail work comes complimentary with any repairs or new ship purchase, and fan club members are free to change the design as frequently as they like, so pimp your ride and then head east to the gift shop and hook the rest of you up with the requisite bling.</desc>

Monodefuego flamethrowers, butane torchers, fondue sets, bikinis, figurines, grenades, and just about any other piece of tacky merchandise you can think of has his image and brand tacked onto it. Shirts cover a wall, most have a picture of the universe&apos;s most successful firemonkey and read &quot;I &lt;heart&gt; Monodefuego&quot;, others have pictures of Djentsch and read, &quot;I &lt;club&gt; Monodefuego&quot;, and perhaps most disturbingly are shirts with a picture of Catspaws, claws drawn, reading, &quot;I &lt;spade&gt; Monodefuego&quot;. Small firemonkey dolls smile adorably around the room. Give the string a pull and it screams and bursts into searing hot flames. A sticker warns they are not suitable for children under the age of 2.</desc>

Many people are coming and going from the building, but they&apos;re all dressed rather sharply and seem very familiar to the guards. It&apos;s probably best if you don&apos;t try to sneak past these guys and just head back to the north.</desc>

You&apos;re immediately served a drink upon being seated, and upon taking a sip you can&apos;t help but notice that there is an... unusual flavor there, underneath it all. Still, the first drink makes you even hungrier and thirstier than when you came in. The room looks a bit fuzzier and you feel a bit... Happier. Feel free to eat and drink as much as you like, but be quick about it... You&apos;re starting to pass out as well, and who knows where those waitdroids are going to take you.</desc>

Every time you insure here it comes with a complimentary tattoo and discounted cosmetic surgery, so while you&apos;re around you might want to take the time to permanently alter your appearance. When you&apos;ve been externally redesigned enough you can head northeast to the gift shop and begin adorning your new, Monodefuego-supportive body and home.</desc>

Therefore an army of spin doctors, politicians, lawyers, media personnel and entertainment producers are kept on staff in order to convey whatever message the situation demands. To this end this entire section of headquarters is dedicated to the development, testing and production of propaganda.

You discover this as you walk through the door and are handed a pamphlet reading at the top, &quot;The Lord High Executioner has found you GUILTY. You are sentenced to serve... in a focus group!&quot; You scream your protestations, but your fate has been sealed. For the next several hours you are forced to review a number of speeches, watch incredibly boring propaganda films, and answer questions about whether the word &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;hound&quot; makes you feel happier.

Those who successfully complete their examinations may find themselves the effective rulers of planets, even solar systems, so the stakes are very high. You manage to sneak a peek at the examination and you realize that almost all of the questions are about Monodefuego! Some of them are very personal as well, like regarding the contents of his medicine cabinet and number of waitdroids on staff in his throne room. The instructor notices your shock, smiles at you and says, &quot;You have to go out with a firemonkey to get in to his head.&quot; Great, riddles too.</desc>

These are the spin offices. They are a magical, happy place that exists in the back rooms after every Presidential debate and in every Media Relations office where absolutely nothing ever goes wrong. Well, at least nothing that is the fault of the individual being represented. No points for guessing who the individual represented in these Spin Offices is. These bustling rooms are responsible for trying to make every idiotic, insane, and evil idea that the firemonkey comes up with sound like this is the policy that heaven itself would lay down if there were any politicians there.

      <name>A Small, Relatively Comfortable Cell</name>
      <desc>Did you really think that just typing &quot;in&quot; was somehow going to magically teleport you right around all those guards and bring you safely into the heavily guarded headquarters? Maybe on other planets, but not on Narcissus! Still, as you are arrested for spying the guards treat you relatively well. They understand your burning desire to gaze upon the brilliant machinations of your master, Monodefuego, and they try to be gentle when they heave you into a detention cell. The good news is you are now inside Monodefuego&apos;s headquarters. The bad news is this room has no exits. You are trapped.</desc>

      <name>Detention Center</name>
      <desc>This room is bustling with activity creating a shuffle of onlookers, children, overseers of sham legal proceedings, judges, juries, jury riggers, prisoners and guards all moving in different directions. Stern looking guards move people insistently, insistant that nobody stand still. You can try fighting the crowd and move to the east, which appears to be the exit. Otherwise you can head northwest to the courtrooms or southwest to... You&apos;re not really sure, but lots of children are coming in and out and it smells funny. Maybe the courtroom is a safer bet.</desc>

      <name>A Frightening Hallway</name>
      <desc>This hallway is lit exclusively by flickering hallogen lights overhead and has an overly-sanitized look to it. The hall is very busily trafficked but virtually silent save for the clicking of heels walking through. The entire atmosphere is grim. The hall itself extends to the east, and there is a foreboding room to the west through which an unusual number of people are passing.</desc>

      <name>A Lengthy Hallway</name>
      <desc>This hallway extends east-west and apart from the brutal propaganda on the walls it&apos;s pretty straightforward. Folks wearing business suits, firemonkey outfits, cheerleading uniforms and bikinis prowl the halls here. Maybe some mysteries are better left unsolved.</desc>

      <name>More Hallways?!</name>
      <desc>Seriously, this hallway obsession of Mono&apos;s has gotten out of control. Hasn&apos;t anyone explained to him that hallways are basically just a waste of space? If all you need is a way for someone to get from point A to point B then why not just take them there? Or at least fill these spaces with something interesting! And yet here we stand, in the middle of a hallway which extends, as you may have guessed, infinitely to the east and to the west, and to the north wraps around a bend. A nondescript, grey door will lead you into a room to the south. It doesn&apos;t look particularly interesting but at least it&apos;s not a hallway.</desc>

      <name>Amazing... the End of the Hallway</name>
      <desc>Well, there is mercy in the universe after all, this hallway ends here with a little room to the east which has an unusually shaped door and from which a bizarre conflagration of sounds and smells emerges. There&apos;s more hallway to the west if you just don&apos;t want all of this hallway-walking fun to end.</desc>

      <name>Non-Human Rec Room</name>
      <desc>Given the size of the universe and the relative idiocy of mankind one would expect humans to be a fairly rare sight in the galaxy. And yet just run some spynet reports on the wealthy and the influential and you&apos;ll find that a vast majority of them are human beings, or at least close enough to count as them. You know what that is? Boring! If humans want their world to be filled with humans they should be able to just remain on earth! Amongst the non-humans, therefore, there is a good deal of speciesism, not too many look favorably upon humanity, viewing them almost as the spoiled, annoying teenagers of the galaxy, low class, and not nearly flammable enough. This extremely comfortable room, featuring shares of all shapes, sizes and durabilities for all non-humans and an array of waitdroids caters specifically to those superior races flying about the universe. If you&apos;re a human in here, I STRONGLY recommend taking the exit to the west.</desc>

      <name>Political Prisoners Petting Zoo</name>
      <desc>Monodefuego&apos;s rise to power was, amazingly, not popular with everyone. Along the way a number of opponents rose up and tried to hinder his claims of absolute power. They sought an open dialogue with both Mono and the public in order to debate the merits of his position or theirs. Mono offered a different, quicker, more cost-effective solution (which, incidentally, was why he was more popular than the politicians in the first place): wipe the brains of his political opponents and replace them with the personalities and habits of various friendly animals. Children laugh with delight and pet former Socialist Enrique Pallamoo, who now believes himself to be a dairy cow, and play with Democracy Advocate Mary Timton in her pig pen, along with a great array of others imprisoned for various opinions and positions. Once you&apos;ve enjoyed your look around you&apos;ll find less smelly environs to the northeast.</desc>

Of course, the real Monodefuego is far too busy to appear in these ridiculous films, so a small army of his firemonkey cousins rush about, screaming, hooting and lighting PAs on fire. He bears very little family resemblence to them but let&apos;s be honest, have you ever been able to tell the difference between firemonkeys? The exit is north.</desc>

      <name>Neuter Non-Humans Room</name>
      <desc>The room is quiet and meditative, constructed mainly out of mahogany and furnished with deep maroon leather sofas and chairs. Some private cloisters are reserved about the room but the majority of it is open and beautiful, with an enormous fire blazing in a fireplace on the far side. The walls are lined with book-laden bookshelves and terminals have been set up for the ultra-wealthy to engage in some commerce in luxury. In short it&apos;s very different from the rest of the facility because this room is dedicated to that enlightened group that has escaped all convention. Unwilling to reproduce in the same manner as the coarser races the aliens here represent the extremely small neuter population of the universe. Freedom from the trappings of sexually-related pressures has enabled them to pursue knowledge, wealth and happiness. Of course, some of them just use the extra energy to set stuff on fire. The exit is out.</desc>

      <name>Monodefuego&apos;s Private Cloister</name>
      <desc>Everything in this room is either burnt to a crisp or soot black, from the chair to the desk to the bed to the walls to the ceiling. Mono generally likes the company of people, and he likes running about wildly, but even he has to rest up sometimes and this is one of the few places he feels comfortable doing so. The room is austere and quiet, and as you may expect smells distinctly like smoke and burnt bananas. A lone waitdroid stands in the corner to carry orders to and from the kitchens and a computer terminal sits soundlessly scrolling the Sanitaria and Narcissus exchanges. When you&apos;re feeling at peace, or when you&apos;re tired of the smell of burnt bananas, you can exit by heading out.</desc>

      <name>Monodefuego&apos;s Narcissus Throne Room</name>
      <desc>Monodefuego&apos;s Throne Room on planet Narcissus is quite an affair indeed. A variety of brainwashed servants stand about, fanning with palm leaves, serving drinks and performing a variety of other services. An enormous and somewhat blackened throne sits near the center of the room, surrounded by displays monitoring everything that takes place on the planet. Each screen is equipped with a large, red button disturbingly marked &quot;SMITE&quot; for purposes which you don&apos;t wish to discover. A set of controls are available for the deployment of spy satellites to other worlds as well. Shuttles are positioned around the room to quickly deliver you almost anywhere on the planet.</desc>

You manage to wriggle through an opening for the ventilation system and begin crawling, James Bond style, through the air ducts. You may be making your escape, but there&apos;s not a whole lot of room for option up here. You can drop back down into the comfort of your cell if you want or you can continue to the east where it looks like things open up a little.</desc>

      <desc>You know, you&apos;ve always found the idea of crawling through an air duct somewhat romantic. The daring spy travelling desperately through an enemy&apos;s base... It just always seemed so sexy. And yet here you are, it&apos;s dirty, it smells bad, it&apos;s loud, it&apos;s cramped, your knees (or equivalent) hurt from exposed bolts and sharp corners. You aren&apos;t going to crawl any further than this, it&apos;s ridiculous. You don&apos;t even have enough room to turn around. Looking down you can see... Well, a room. Hard to say what it is. All you know is you aren&apos;t crawling one more inch. You&apos;re going DOWN now.</desc>

      <desc>A head emerges slowly from the hole in your cell. Mercifully instead of Pennywise it&apos;s just a kindly old man. He&apos;s been trapped in these prisons ever since they were first constructed, and he&apos;s spent all this time tunneling. Looking at you he&apos;s clearly unimpressed until his gaze wanders down to your feet and he notices your flaming slippers. &quot;Don&apos;t you realize,&quot; he says, plainly excited, &quot;The power to leave your cell has been with you all along! Just click your heels together three times saying, &apos;All Hail Monodefuego&apos; and you&apos;ll be free. Only take me with you!&quot; Of course, if he really wanted you to take him with you, he would have made the deal before hand. You&apos;re already clicking your heels before he&apos;s done shrieking curses and you disappear OUT of the room.</desc>

      <desc>You are inside the head of the enormous, golden Monodefuego standing in the headquarters lobby. You can hardly think this is the solution to the riddle, right outside the room. Is Mono really crazy enough for that? A small inscription on the panel in front of you reads, &quot;Yes I am that crazy, but no, this is not the solution to the puzzle.&quot; Well, that&apos;s a relief anyway. An array of buttons, knobs and levers is spread out on the panel in front of you, each of them a bright, shiny color and beckoning you to press with such tantalizing labels as, &quot;Laser Eyes&quot;, &quot;Trap Door in Floor&quot; and &quot;Eaten by Giant Statue&quot;. When you&apos;re done playing around you can get out of the head by going out.  Duh.</desc>

      <name>Credits</name>
      <desc>Hello! This is Monodefuego&apos;s player, Brian Klebig. I figured that a planet called Narcissus would be a good place for me to talk a little about myself and give anyone who was interested a look at the man behind the firemonkey. If you know Mono you may be surprised to know that I&apos;m a Pastor with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod (ELS), which is also how Mono knows all of those foreign languages. I consider Mono to be a cathartic anti-me, though maybe there&apos;s more of him in me than I&apos;d care to admit. I was raised in California but I&apos;ve lived in a number of states. I&apos;m married to a beautiful woman and we don&apos;t have any kids right now. Our main interest would be travel which I have the opportunity to do a great deal of for fun, for mission work and for study purposes. Thanks for visiting my planets, see if you can find every location! There are lots more secrets! Down will take you to the neuter room, and out to the LP.</desc>
