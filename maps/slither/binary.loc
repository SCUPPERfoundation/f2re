      <desc>   After stepping into the capsule it accelerates to a bone shaking speed. The capsule speed is so great that it actually leaves the oscillator tracks at the highest points, at the bends, and at breaks in the track where the links between oscillators have not been finished. Your insides are twisted and knotted by the vibration.</desc>
      <desc>   The capsule now slows down and glides along the track and passes through a port in the hull. You have time to relax and admire the view of Jupiter before the capsule passes right through the middle of the glowing blue plasma jet. You and your fellow joy riders turn a ghostly blue, quickly followed by a sickly green color. If you weren&apos;t so numb your whole body would be suffering with excruciating pins and needles. The capsule slows and to get it moving again you need to shift your body weight to one side.</desc>

Professor Reinhardt was awarded last year&apos;s Nobel Prize for his elucidation of DNA structures in the genetic code, DNA being the instruction manual for life itself.</desc>
      <desc>   The new techniques he has developed allow the cross mutation of inert commodities with the DNA of alien creatures. The Corporation stresses that the original DNA used in the Professor&apos;s research was that found on an obscure asteroid outside of the Solar System and transported to Binary by Armstrong Cuthbert couriers.You unconsciously substitute &apos;smuggled&apos;.</desc>

      <name>Office of Professor Reinhardt</name>
      <desc>   This room is an organized mess. Papers and books litter the desk spilling over onto the floor. After the stifling heat of the other rooms at this level this office is surprisingly cool, explained by the noisy air conditioning unit on the back wall. A colorful diploma hanging on the wall is dedicated to Professor Reinhardt and applauds his ground breaking research of mutations to alien life forms and biocomponents.</desc>
      <desc>   A technical journal has been left on the bookcase, on the west wall, and is open at an article about Professor Reinhardt.</desc>

      <name>Breeding laboratory</name>
      <desc>   This is one of the two breeding laboratories in this facility. A technician is handling small test tubes labelled &apos;Rath DNA&apos; and is mixing the DNA strings with proteins and enzymes from jars on the bench. After zapping the mix with a high voltage probe the bioplasm created is attached to a &apos;Prorath&apos; memory module. A second technician picks up a finished memory module and walks out the door in the direction of the memory areas. This laboratory is extremely hot and dry. No doubt the processor and memory module bioplasms prefer it that way.</desc>

      <desc>   Unless you are a trash item you should not be in this room. Bioplasms that failed the Corporation&apos;s genetic engineering processes are deposited here and allowed to feast on all the waste products of the space station. As you turn around and look for a way out you collide with a partly digested Encyclopedia Galactica and confiscated customs exemption certificates. Loud gurgling and burping sounds come from the void below the floor grid. The exit is through the maintenance hatch in the north wall.</desc>

      <desc>   Why do employers put the staff rest room in the most inaccessible and disgusting of places? Looking round you realize that the absence of an exit door means that you will have to climb up through the maintenance hatch in the ceiling to get out, but you are just too short to reach it. An employee has left a shopping trolley in a corner of the room. You may be able to use the shopping trolley to reach the hatch. You need to move to the other end of the room to reach it.</desc>

      <name>Anti room</name>
      <desc>   Screen displays illustrate the history of The Slitherion Corporation and Binary.</desc>
      <desc>   Binary started as a small insignificant space station owned by a venture capitalist who foresaw a need for a computer facility in the Solar System. The station, which was constructed from conventional materials, was operated by the owner himself but due to inadequate management and working procedures along with computer failures, profits were nonexistent.</desc>
      <desc>   The company suffered several shareholder revolts until the owner gave up and offered the company for sale at a bargain price. The Slitherion Corporation was looking for a suitable home for their bio computer division and with their broker organized a take over of the space Station, renaming the station Binary in the process.</desc>

      <desc>   Further screens display more information about Binary.</desc>
      <desc>   They refurbished the station, adding a bioplasm coating to most of the internal surfaces which took over all power and data transfer from the old conventional copper and fiber cabling. They also evolved other bioplasms to generate power, process data and handle memory functions in a much improved way.</desc>
      <desc>   Slitherion&apos;s tradition for always winning contracts over their competitors (you mentally substitute bribery and corruption for the word winning) has substantially increased their profits and they are now one of the largest and richest Corporations in the Solar System.</desc>
      <desc>   The exit from this antiroom is through the northwest portal. The other anti room is through the west door.</desc>
