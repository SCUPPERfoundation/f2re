      <name>Ice field</name>
      <desc>   Outside the somewhat sheltered confines of the landing field to the southwest, the icy wind is so strong it almost knocks you off your feet. A light dusting of snow is falling, and it swirls around in gusts before forming drifts all around you.</desc>
      <desc>   To the East an Ice~Farm can be sighted.</desc>

      <name>Landing pad</name>
      <desc>   Huge drifts of snow and banks of solid ice enclose the field, but they don&apos;t keep the bitter wind out. Igloos - small buildings fashioned from blocks of ice - house the planet&apos;s essential services.</desc>
      <desc>   Southwest is the trading exchange, east is the hospital and a bar which serves lovely warming drinks is south. Northeast, a break in the ice bank lets you venture out onto the frozen wastes of the planet.</desc>
      <desc>   A small droid, with ice encrusted around its head, trundles up and offers to sell you a new ship.</desc>

      <name>Life and Death, Inc.</name>
      <desc>   Visitors to this planet often come to grief by underestimating the dangers of an ice world, and the hospital does a brisk trade in patching them back together if possible, or activating their clones if the injuries are too serious.</desc>
      <desc>   If you need it, the staff here can arrange insurance for you.</desc>
      <desc>   When you&apos;re done, the exit door is west.</desc>

      <name>Trading igloo</name>
      <desc>   Technology melds with nature... set into the iceblock walls of this igloo are the electronic trading screens, letting you buy and sell commodities, or order a variety of useful goods.</desc>
      <desc>   Natives of the planet cluster around the screens, clothed in thick fur to keep out the bitter cold. Thankfully the controls are voice-operated so the locals don&apos;t have to take off their thick fur mittens.</desc>
      <desc>   The exit back out into the cold is northeast.</desc>

      <name>Overlord&apos;s hostel</name>
      <desc>   This hostel&apos;s owner, an elegant albino man, smiles a welcome to you and offers you a steaming mug of what passes for coffee on this planet.</desc>
      <desc>   There&apos;s a roaring fire in the center of this igloo, making it warm enough for the natives to remove at least the outer layers of their clothing... but the fire doesn&apos;t melt the icy walls. Very clever!</desc>
      <desc>   A native woman sits in the corner stitching furs together into clothing. Clearly, the new chameleon clothing hasn&apos;t made it this far.</desc>
      <desc>   To leave the comfort and warmth of the hostel, go north.</desc>
