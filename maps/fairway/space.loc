      <name>Fairway System Interstellar Link</name>
      <desc>Your spaceship comes to rest beside the Fairway Interstellar Link. Your comm crackles with a pre-recorded message.  &quot;Greetings space traveler. You are here.&quot; Your navigational sensor shows a map of the Fairway System. A large blue arrow is superimposed on the map showing your proximity to the interstellar link within Fairway Space. You squint at the navigational sensor and for some reason that only you find funny, think that Fairway Space resembles a dog&apos;s leg. You chuckle at the thought when your comm crackles &quot;Please proceed carefully in a general easterly direction to your destination or if you leaving the Fairway System, please use the interstellar link to jump to your next location. Have a nice day!&quot;</desc>

      <desc>You are flying through Fairway Space which appears to devoid of any navigational aids and space debris. You glance over at the system map on your navigational sensors and notice that routes to the west and east appear on the screen. Your short-range sensors also pick up a spatial anomaly which appears to be forming above you. You quickly check your ship computer&apos;s readout to make sure the proper coordinates are locked in. Seeing no problems you settle back into your bridge chair and watch your ship&apos;s progress on the system map displayed on the navigational sensor.</desc>

If you are outbound from the system then the interstellar link is located approximately 150,000 nautical space miles in a general westerly direction from here.

Its automated detection sensors pick up your approaching vessel and began broadcasting its directional message. &quot;Greetings traveler, if you are inbound to the system you are approximately 150,000 nautical space miles from the planet Green which is located in a southeasterly direction from here and 50,000 nautical space miles from the planet Hazard which lies directly to the west of this beacon. If you are outbound from the system then the interstellar link is located approximated 250,000 nautical space miles in a westerly direction from here.

      <name>Hazard Orbit</name>
      <desc>You are in orbit above the planet Hazard. Long-range scanners indicate that the entire surface of the planet is covered by water. Using your deep probe sensors you determine that there is massive amounts of underwater vegetation present which helps oxygenate the water thereby allowing aquatic life to flourish. Sensors also show many habitable underwater domes lying beneath the surface of the planet&apos;s sea. Most domes appear white on the infrared sensors, probably due to the lack of anyone living there. Occasionally your sensors pick up a yellow or orange dome, which indicates the presence of life. Since your spaceship or shuttle is not equipped for underwater travel you should avoid landing on Hazard. Your navigational sensors indicate that you can go westerly to the interstellar link or southerly back to the Fairway Space.</desc>

      <desc>You are flying through space when your short-range sensors start flashing a warning. You turn to the sensor screen and see that you are flying into an area that appears to have a heavy concentration of space debris. Your weapons and armament computer automatically switches on your defensive shields and extra power is diverted to your hull plating. As the debris buffets your spaceship you think perhaps you should manually alter your course rather than continuing through this rough area of space. Glancing over to the short-range sensors you notice a small opening in the debris field. You realize you only have small window of time to get out of the debris field or you will have to endure more buffeting and roughness. You switch off your navigation computer and take manually control of the ship. You hope you can maneuver your way out successfully.</desc>

      <desc>You begin to steer your ship through the thinnest part of the debris field when your elbow accidentally touches a switch and the navigational computer retakes control of the spaceship. Locking onto the last entered coordinates the computer brings the spaceship back into the dense debris field. Fortunately your shields and hull have held intact and have deflected all of the debris which has your spaceship has flown through. But for how long? You quickly glance back over to your short-range sensors looking for a way out of this debris field.</desc>

      <desc>You are flying through Fairway Space which appears to devoid of any navigational aids and space debris. You glance over at the system map on your navigational sensors and notice that routes to the northwest and southeast appear on the screen. Seeing no problems you settle back into your bridge chair and watch your ship&apos;s progress on the system map displayed on the navigational sensor. Suddenly your comm unit comes alive with an urgent sounding message. You hear the word &quot;FORE&quot; being said repeatedly. As you ponder the meaning of such a message, your short-range sensors detect a small circular spaceship flying across your intended path of travel. A quick check of the sensors indicates that your ship is in no danger from this errant craft. As it passes by you and out of sensor range, your comm unit again comes to life. A single message is heard this time. &quot;SORRY&quot; and then the comm unit goes silent. Detecting no further problems you relax and continue to track your ship&apos;s progress.</desc>

      <desc>You are in orbit around the large moon Fringe. The surface of the moon appears barren except for a small Fairway System sanctioned outpost near the equatorial region of the moon that is currently off limits to travelers. It is rumored however, that a small element of rogue traders aka &quot;The Fringe Element&quot; have a small base of operations on the moon, but as yet local authorities have yet to find any evidence of it&apos;s location. Your navigational sensor indicates that you can go west to Fairway Space. You wonder if you can fire your outboard retro engines to attempt to put you down in orbit around Green.</desc>

      <name>Green Orbit</name>
      <desc>You are orbiting the planet Green. Of all four planets &amp; moons in the Fairway System, Green was the most suitable for humanoid colonization. It has an overall mild global climate, an abundance of indigenous harmless wildlife, natural resources and a natural calming effect on its inhabitants. It is said that even visiting travelers experience this calming effect once they reach the planet Green.  A quick scan of life signs indicates a sparsely populated planet with communities located in the most desirable locations of the planet. Apparently the planet hasn&apos;t been heavily colonized yet. Your navigational sensors indicate you can go northwest to Fairway Space. Engaging your outboard retro engines will place you in a geosynchronous path with the small asteroid moon Bunker or firing your main engines will take you up into orbit around the larger moon Fringe.</desc>
