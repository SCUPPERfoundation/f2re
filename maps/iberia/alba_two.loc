      <name>Shuttle Port</name>
      <desc>   Shuttles pack this plain, enormous, gunmetal-gray storage area. Droids buzz here and there and the air is filled with a mechanical din in the interest of keeping all the shuttles in flying form. One side of the room is a gaping hole that allows the shuttles to enter and exit. Through this entryway, the stars glimmer, and the broad curve of Alba II is just barely visible along the bottom. On the opposite side, to the southeast, is a comparatively smaller doorway into the rest of the station. To one side of the door is a notice informing all visitors that rules on the space station, Carlos V, are reasonably relaxed but that travel to Alba II is highly restricted due to the reasonably primitive nature of the &apos;natives.&apos;</desc>

      <name>Alba II Ship Services</name>
      <desc>  A friendly-looking droid stands behind a little desk. It grins broadly at all who enter its small corner of the station. The whole room is done in a drab gunmetal gray, but a large transparent panel wraps around three walls, the fourth to the east occupied by a door. On one wall is a bunch of pamphlets with pricing schedules and ship designs and comparisons.</desc>
      <desc>   On the other wall is a series of view screens so that customers can observe the work done either on their existing ship or their new one. However, many patrons prefer to watch out through the window, trying to spot which ship in the distance is theirs. The droid almost certainly finds it curious how living beings would rather try to see things with their own imperfect senses than employ the provided technology. But she just stands there, grinning, hand perpetually hovering over her console as she awaits a new order. Creepy, really, until she&apos;s put her to work.</desc>

      <name>Storage Bay</name>
      <desc>   Due to space considerations on the station, this sizable corridor is packed with boxes, bags, agricultural equipment, and tools of all descriptions. Walking space has been left along the northern and western walls, meeting at the entrance door to the shuttle port. Strangely, the tools and equipment appear to be of types that went out of style centuries, if not millennia, ago. Also disconcerting is a relatively small stand of boxes labeled TNT, a pre-space flight explosive. In fact, only a few of the crates are made of materials widely used in the rest of the universe, and many are made of wood.</desc>
      <desc>   Cardboard signs temporarily hung on stored objects indicate that the door in the south wall leads to planetside transportation and facilities uninteresting to the casual visitor, the door in the east wall is the entrance to a gravshaft, and the northwestern portal brings visitors back to the shuttle port. A modest door in the middle of the west wall is labeled &apos;shipyard.&apos;</desc>

The &apos;natural&apos; light from above is almost in competition with the artificial light illuminating the first floor, giving a double-lit appearance, pretty eerie if you ask me. To the west is the storage bay and, through there, the shuttle port.

The whole place smells strongly of disinfectant, the belief being that things are going to get messy regardless of all efforts to the contrary, and the best situation is to clean the place constantly. Lucky for patients, there is a shifty looking man behind a counter marked &apos;Insurance&apos;. The door, by the way, is to the southwest and will bring you back into the garden on Carlos V.</desc>

      <desc>   From the door in the east wall a catwalk extends into this giant room whose walls are covered with viewing screens and control panels. The roof of the room is flat, while the rest of the wall is hemispherical. At the far end of the catwalk are floating seats that can be used to access control surfaces. At any given time, most are in use by the several crew members employed in keeping the station running. Frankly, the crew members generally stay at certain critical stations while only one or two zip between the less important consoles to make sure that there are no emergency situations.</desc>
      <desc>   Interestingly, only about a quarter of the screens show images from inside and outside the Carlos V while the balance of the screens show lush tropical images from the planet. A disproportionate number of these show the fields, farms, and worker living quarters on the planet. The only exit is to the east, back into the corridor.</desc>

The walls are the same gunmetal gray color used in the storage bay and shuttle port. About halfway along the corridor, two doors are set into the walls. To the west, the door is marked &apos;Control Room&apos; while to the east, the sign on the door reads &apos;Machine Room&apos;. At the southern end of this corridor is an airlock that leads, according to the label, to a room through which the planet itself can be accessed, while the door to the storage bay is at the northern end.</desc>

      <desc>   To call this place a machine room is a bit of a misnomer. Machine rooms are noisy places, filled with air and water pumps, motors, and all other manner of clanking, clunking, and otherwise mechanical devices. In fact, this room is filled with a chorus of soft humming created by machines that control the gravity in the space station or generate power, along with a few well-lubricated and quiet electrical motors. Quite frankly, there is little interesting in this room besides a door in the western wall that leads back to the hallway.</desc>

Directly ahead of the door is a matching set surrounding a coffee table, and just beyond that are two straight-backed chairs, only propery stuffed, sitting in front of an enormous mahogany desk, behind which is a tall-backed chair on wheels. On the far back wall is a map of the Iberian Peninsula of Earth with the feudal political distinctions of the middle of the fifteenth century, Common Era. To one side, a stairwell can be seen.</desc>
      <desc>   On the left side of the room is a wooden table with four chairs that can be used for meals, and beyond that is a heavy stone, cut at about waist-high. In the middle of it is a holoprojector above which floats a round, bluish-green planet. An engraving around the edge on the table top identifies the planet as the original Alba, along with a list of pertinent dates. The last date marks the acquisition of Alba II.</desc>

At strategic areas, bare stained logs support the walls and ceiling. A modest fountain runs in the middle of the room, keeping the place cool and giving it a fresh scent. Four tables are set up, each with a set of five straight-backed chairs upholstered in colorful cloth. Wait droids hover at one wall, waiting to take orders from anyone who is waiting.</desc>
      <desc>   The floor is the same red clay tiles seen in other buildings, and the roof is done all in a deep brown wood. The roof sits only over the front half of the room, suggesting an upstairs towards the back. There is no secretary, no desk, no work station to speak of here. Presumably either the visitors or the man behind the great oak doors to the west knows whose turn is when. Loafing is not entirely discouraged, but the patience of the planet owner is limited, though it may not always seem so.</desc>

      <desc>   This upper level of the station is a glorious park. Soft grass blankets the floor all around while oak trees, elm trees, and other trees and shrubs have been carefully placed in order to appear as if they appeared there naturally, all of the plant life originating from Earth. Besides the floor, there are no enclosing walls of any sort. Instead, a transparent dome was fitted on this level. From the control room, a semi-opaque blue tint can be added for the times when the sun is in view. At night, the tint is removed and the ambient lights dimmed or turned off to allow a view of the stars. Being in geosynchronous orbit, night and day are approximately the same length as on the planet.</desc>
      <desc>   To the north sits the gravshaft tube, while to the east and west are stucco buildings with brick-colored tiles on the roof. To the southeast is the exchange, while to the northeast is a white building with a red cross on a sign out front. The park continues to the south.</desc>

The fronts of the buildings are open either completely or forming an exterior countertop and the smell of Moorish cuisine emanates from all of the buildings. Rice dishes and thick soups are sold in some shops, while desserts smelling of cinnamon and other spices are in others. There is also no shortage of bars dispensing drinks, although technically the Moors did not consume alcohol. Hey, it&apos;s a party!</desc>
      <desc>   The east end of the street ends in a shop selling Islamic trinkets and copies of the Qur&apos;an. On Earth, these were powerful symbols of faith, but now they are trite and, frankly, tasteless novelties. Back to the west is the access to the garden.</desc>

Labels on the walls give the illusion of &apos;up&apos; and &apos;down&apos; in accord with the rest of the station. Most of the portals are marked &apos;emergency only,&apos; obviously life boats. At present, only one shuttle to the planet is accessible. It is labeled Leon and is &apos;up&apos; from the center of the room. Another portal, &apos;downwards,&apos; is covered with a metal disc, preventing passage and covering the label. In the north wall is an airlock that leads to the cylindrical corridor and the rest of the station.</desc>

The silks are each a different color, and off to one side is a huge bank of pillows in matching colors set on a shaggy rug over the tile. A roll-top desk sits next to one of the large windows, and a pair of very comfy chairs sit in front of a fireplace approximately in the same place as the one downstairs, putting it away from the walls.</desc>

Two beds are set about ten feet from each other against the wall furthest from the stairs, and these have multi-colored comforters to match all the silks. Both beds are large enough to accommodate at least three sleepers comfortably. A cabinet near the fire place boasts a wide selection of drinks.</desc>

      <desc>   This southern stretch of the garden is much the same as the northern. More perennial flowers and fewer trees occupy this area, giving the area a more open appearance, but also a more manicured one. The area is criss-crossed by cobbled paths which have occasional benches along their length. At the extreme southern end of the garden, near the bubble wall, is an area separated by a low rail fence. It has obviously been planted on purpose; all of the individuals are of the same pungent plant with seven-lobed leaves with serrate edges. Though they seem vaguely familiar to most visitors, few could ever name them. Near the middle of this garden is a sizable lake stocked with happy, robotic fish.</desc>
      <desc>   Off to the southeast can be seen a gothic-style building that is the Obradoiro Hotel, while to the southwest is a restaurant done in the elaborate Moorish style. While both are in the style of houses of worship, there is very little praying in either.</desc>

The floors are made of the same clay tile, but the room is jammed full of consoles so that traders can do... whatever it is that they do. A quiet hum fills this room along with the comforting blue glow of console screens. Keeping the &apos;natives&apos; in a constantly primitive state requires that while storage and shipping facilities are kept on the planet, the transactions of commerce must take place in the Carlos V. Some things, such as modest industrial installations and the constant sight of freight craft act against the owner&apos;s wishes, but little can be done about it. Of course, the elaborate transfer protocol gives those rotten stevedores more opportunities for thievery, and only through bribing his work force can the planet owner keep things in check.</desc>

      <name>Leon&apos;s Home</name>
      <desc>   The small shuttle sits upright Buck-Rogers-style in a cypress log frame. Every time it lands, it destroys the roof, but every time, within ten minutes, the natives have covered the nose of the shuttle with palm frond thatch, creating a cozy little house for the transport. How the natives get here so fast is a bit of a puzzler however, because the place is surrounded with dense rainforest. To the west is what passes for a path through the forest, but it is as good as it gets. The Carlos V is accessible from here merely by going in to the shuttle.</desc>

      <name>Interlocking-Brick Pathway</name>
      <desc>   The path opens up here into a large courtyard dominated by an enormous hotel to the southeast. The building is maybe fifteen stories high, the west and south walls lined with open-air walkways. Its roof is done in clay-red tiles and the building itself is shining white with a large, stylized, golden &apos;R&apos; on one side. All around the courtyard are casuarina trees holding back the jungle and almost obscuring a high chain-link fence around the perimeter.</desc>
      <desc>   Though a large water feature just before the glass doors of the lobby as well as colorful perennials in planters make this courtyard very pretty, the occasional low growl suggests that the best course of action would be to enter the doors to the southeast or follow the path northward off the property.</desc>

      <name>Club Luna, Upper Floor</name>
      <desc>   The upper level of the club is not a single upstairs, but a series of terraces each a few feet higher than the other. They spiral up the walls of the club so that there is an unobstructed view down to the dance floor while there are chromed rails about three feet high with glass panels to prevent accidents. A variety of chairs and couches line the walls, and though none look particularly comfortable, they&apos;ll do in a pinch.</desc>
      <desc>   At the very top floor, where the wooden ceiling slopes down in a pyramid shape, is another bar, this one with much more comfortable stools. It&apos;s a good deal darker up here, and the dance floor three stories below is brightly lit in contrast. The music also has faded, making this a rather nice refuge from the more intense lower levels. Drinks are, however, still absurdly priced. The stairs lead down through the terraces back to the floor level.</desc>

      <name>Club Luna, Lower Floor</name>
      <desc>   The club is done all in blue-grey, with wide bolts of fabric hanging across non-standard corners to give that &apos;under construction&apos; feeling. The music isn&apos;t too loud, but on the dance floor it&apos;s enough to lose oneself. The bar is off in one back corner and the only set of facilities is in a front corner, but both can be reached with an acceptable amount of crowd-infiltration. In the other two corners are stairs leading up to the terraced levels.</desc>
      <desc>   Luna is the hot spot for all the young professionals and dignitaries, the Registry being a bit more stylish and hip than the Obradoiro on the space station. While it is kind of a long walk back to the shuttle Leon, the lighter architecture and atmosphere seem worth it. Also, there&apos;s a club! Luna continues up the stairs while a corridor to the south leads back to the fourth floor landing.</desc>

      <name>Lobby of The Registry</name>
      <desc>   This huge, opulent lobby behind the glass doors has the floor and the walls up to the chair rail done in off-white marble with pink veining. In the middle between the doors and the check-in kiosk (also in marble) is a yellow-gold stone, stylized R set in an obsidian diamond set into the marble floor, flush with it. The check-in kiosk is circular and has a pedestal of the off-white marble and a counter made of the obsidian.</desc>
      <desc>   Strangely, behind the counter are computerized consoles! The real, live, and rather pale humans behind there smile broadly if less than believably. The large, open ground floor extends to the east and southeast to a bunch of elevators and a gift shop respectively. To the south, through a wall of solid glass, can be seen a pool.</desc>

      <desc>   Three elevator doors stand in a row with two shiny &apos;up&apos; buttons between them. The doors and jambs are of brass polished to a gleam. The walls from the chair rail up are coral colored and textured with a sponge to give them a soft appearance, while below that and even onto the floor it is done in the off-white marble with pink accents.</desc>
      <desc>   A sign next to the door apologetically explains that without a room key, only the fourth floor is accessible, with its bar and club. However, the gift shop to the south, the lobby to the west, and a dim restaurant to the east can be reached without obstruction, and only a glass door separates this elevator bank from the pool to the southwest.</desc>

      <name>TDP Restaurant</name>
      <desc>   The TDP has booths all along the walls elevated by a step. Six or seven other two- and four-top tables sit in the intervening space, all of the seats upholstered in calf-skin. The bar, in the southeast corner, is three-quarters of a circle surrounded by stools with backs in the same style as the other chairs. The fourth quarter of the bar is left for access by the wait-staff, who are all human, to the kitchen.</desc>
      <desc>   From the center of the ceiling to the north and east walls hang broad bolts of off-white cloth in contrast to the dark-brown stained oak panels on the wall. Large cushions set against the north and west walls and upholstered in the same fabric complete the setup. The whole place is lit dimly, albeit with electric lights, in order to create ambience. The only exit is back to the west into the hall between here and the lobby.</desc>

The glass door to the southeast leads out into an open walkway while the one to the southwest opens out onto a lovely veranda. A corridor just to the left of the elevators in the north wall leads into a slightly darker room with the latest popular music echoing even into this landing.</desc>

      <name>A Quiet Hotel Room</name>
      <desc>   Placed in the southwest corner of the building, room #420 has three walls made almost completely of glass. While the south wall shows the lovely walkway, and through it the sea, the east wall has a commanding view of the jungle as it slopes away from the hotel as well as a lovely sugar-sand beach where the cliff the hotel is built on diminishes to nothing. Out the north wall, the jungle rises in a dramatic crescendo to a high mountain still covered with dense green foliage.</desc>
      <desc>   The room itself is enormous! A king-size waterbed sits in the middle of the west wall across from an oversized mini-bar. A controller on the night table determines the positioning of the curtains as well as the tint of the windows. Four chairs surrounding a semi-circular table against the north window provide a comfortable place to relax and watch the birds flit from spot to spot in the canopy. And when it&apos;s time to check-out, the exit is &apos;out&apos;.</desc>

      <name>Cliffside Pool</name>
      <desc>   The south side of this pool is lower than the rest, allowing the water to flow over and providing the illusion that there is no barrier there at all, which provides an unabated view to the sea. It&apos;s meant to appear continuous, but because the hotel is on a cliff, it merely causes vertigo in the less stout visitors. For this reason, a droid with a skimmer bobs unobtrusively in one corner.</desc>
      <desc>   Off to the west end of the pool there is an attached hot tub large enough for twelve people or so. The deck is covered in lounge chairs in light blue and white stripes. The whole patio is bordered by a quarter-circle arc of a glass wall with three doors. The door to the north leads to the lobby, the one to the northeast leads to the elevators and from there to the rooms, and the door to the east leads to the gift shop, a must-see for all visitors with too many groats.</desc>

      <desc>   A droid stands behind the counter, the big ticket items such as Vak-42s back there with him. The rest of the rather sizeable boutique is absolutely packed with things most people wouldn&apos;t even think about buying on vacation. There are knife-sets, feminine products, ping-pong paddles, shot glasses, and pewter mugs all emblazoned with that stylized R; some even carry the caption, &quot;The Registry, Alba II.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   Three stands of postcards offer every scene a visitor could think of sending back home, plus two or three that wouldn&apos;t make that cut. Some of the images on the postcards aren&apos;t even from this planet! Shirts, shorts, bathing suits, and sandals hang from various racks, marked either with the symbol of the Registry or the symbols of Alba. All of them carry the name of the local sweat shop... errr... apparel manufactory, Napoli. Some of these are subtle, but most are quite obvious or even prominent.</desc>

      <name>Large Veranda</name>
      <desc>   A decagonal platform is built off the side of the building out of heavy, white-washed timbers to resemble a gazebo, complete with the ornate woodwork hanging from the beams that make up the roof. The northeast side is the glass door of the landing, but the other sides have a railing with more ornate woodwork below while above there is nothing but open air. Opposite the door, across the baked-clay tile floor, is a large quarter-circle bar with a green padded armrest along its outer edge. Fancy white folding patio chairs sit in groups of four and five around tables in the rest of the area, but tall, padded, white stools sit along the perimeter of the darkly stained wooden bar.</desc>
      <desc>   The tables are arranged so that there is a clear path to the bar while wait droids flitter around providing service to the tables. At night, strings of small lights hang around the eaves while the cool sea breeze blows away unwelcome biting insects.</desc>

In order to remain concealed, it is not very wide, but to the south is a lovely little octagonal home. Just beyond the home, the cliff resumes. From up above, the Registry towers, its height embellished by the sharp angle up to it and the stretch of bare rock intervening. Around the edges of this modest clearing, light brush creeps along where it can; there are even a couple of stunted palm trees.</desc>

Large double doors on three sides give access to balconies meaning allowing one to sit and enjoy the magnificent views. The doors are almost permanently open, letting the fresh wind cool down the inside. Cream-colored curtains flutter next to the doors.</desc>
      <desc>One area of the room is hidden behind rattan screens, but behind it you can see a four-poster bed with a multi-colored spread. Netting is hung around it to prevent bugs coming in, and to provide some privacy. A small black-and-white cat</desc>

      <desc>Spread throughout the room you see comfortable chairs couches, a bar with a near-endless selection of finest wines from Sauterne and brown liquids from around FedSpace.
