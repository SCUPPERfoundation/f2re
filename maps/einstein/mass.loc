      <desc>Under the old grandstands of Stagg Field, you see a structure apparently composed of black bricks. Physicists in white smocks slowly insert long, cylindrical rods into the structure, consulting with each other as they gather information from the instrumentation installed in the structure, which they oddly refer to as a &apos;pile&apos;. A supervisor admonishes a female technician, bellowing &apos;Dammit, Janet, pay attention&apos;!</desc>

      <desc>Presided over by the reknowned Dr. Frank N. Furter, this is the Training Center for aspiring Einstein System propulsion engineers. Above the marble entrance is carved the University&apos;s motto: Illegitimi Non Carborundum.</desc>
      <desc>  All known principles of planetary, system, and inter-galactic propulsion systems are taught here. With an 80% failure rate, admission standards are stringent, and graduation is not only something to be proud of, it also marks you as one destined for command in the Einsteinian Galactic Navy (EGN).  The exit is south-east.</desc>

Charles Gray, with his hands on his hips, ensures no time slips, supervising with quiet dignity.

A somewhat deranged individual, sitting on a Harley, introduces himself as &apos;Eddie&apos; and informs you that this area is under construction, and that further travel is prohibited. The exit is east, and you beat a hasty retreat to the surreal tone of a saxaphone. And on that note, you sense a quote, and wonder where the Desaxman is, and what he is up to......</desc>

      <desc>Welcome to Oppenheimer City. You are at the center for transportation on planet Mass, beyond the LP Industrial Complex. Oddly, the center appears to have been built as a replica of an eighteenth century english mansion. To the south east you see a door. Opening it, you see a group of wierdly-dressed masked individuals doing some kind of strange dance. You rapidly close the door, jumping back and nearly stumbling over Brad and Janet, who were looking over your shoulder.</desc>

      <desc>Chef Kermit specializes in beef he has searched for throughout the galaxy, far and wide. His signature presentation is Steak Pittsburgh, a select fillet grilled quickly on a very hot grill, black on the outside, but cool and rare, nearly raw, on the inside. It is served with a baked potato, loaded with butter, sour cream, cheese of your choice, chives, and fresh bacon bits if you so wish, the choice is up to you. You can also order a side of a fresh veggies, steamed, not cooked.</desc>

      <name>Mass Shuttle Pad</name>
      <desc>Welcome to Mass! As you exit your shuttle, the gravity effect nearly knocks you to your knees. But with a blurring of your vision, an aura forms about you, and you feel as light as if you were on Selena. Testing your equilibrium, you take a jump to the left, and a step to the right. A fellow traveller with stringy blond hair, introducing himself as Riff Raff, joins you, nods approvingly, and shouts &quot;Let&apos;s do the Time Warp again!&quot; You nervously look away.</desc>
      <desc>  You know your destination is the exchange to the east. However, you can also see the Emergency Room to the north, the MC Squared Steak House to the west, and the Unified Field Effects Shipyard to the south, where you can buy a new ship, perhaps at a discount, or repair your damaged ship.</desc>

      <desc>The noise here is deafening. Local traders shout their buy and sell orders to the exchange droid. Looking about, you locate a series of of booths reserved for visitors. One seems odd, clad entirely in force-foam. Then you notice the sign on the door, indicating that the booth is reserved for Trillith.</desc>
      <desc>   Thankfully, you find a vacant booth, and close the door. Looking at the equipment and finding no keyboard, you are confused. You none-the-less settle into the comfortable chair and are startled when the keyboard emerges from the front of the well-upholstered Naugahyde armrest and locks in front of you. Idly wondering how many naugas gave their all for the chair, you begin to concentrate on placing your orders.</desc>

Alternatively, you can repair your ship here, but the Einstein warp drive is not availabe as an upgrade, except to special customers.</desc>
