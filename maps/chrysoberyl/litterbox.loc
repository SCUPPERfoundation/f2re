      <name>Romantic Hideaway</name>
      <desc>   This is a special place to be alone with that very special someone.   There is a fireplace on one wall, with large cushions in front of it.   The floor is carpeted with a soft plush carpet that your feet sink into.   There is a small loveseat facing the fire, and a bottle of champagne and  two glasses can be seen on the table beside it.   A stereo provides soft mood music, and the lighting is very dim.  EAST will take you back to the Party Room.</desc>

      <name>Party Room</name>
      <desc>   You have entered a room decorated with ballons and streamers.  Champagne is  being handed to everyone by demure little waitresses.  A lively band plays in  one corner.  This area is still under construction, so be sure to check back!   IN will take you back to the shuttle pad.  NORTH goes to the sauna, EAST to the Catnip Cafe, and SOUTH to the Christmas Room.  To the WEST is a small romantic Hideaway!</desc>

      <name>The Catnip Cafe</name>
      <desc>   This is a small intimate cafe where you can enjoy a quiet meal.   (The specialty, of course, is seafood!)   There are about half a dozen candlelit tables scattered around the room,  and a violinist wanders from table to table serenading young lovers.   WEST will take you back to the party room.</desc>

      <name>A Pussycat&apos;s Christmas</name>
      <desc>   You have just entered Catspaws&apos; Christmas room.   The first thing you notice is that there are Christmas trees everywhere,  and there are thousands of cats playing in them.  (Cats don&apos;t care whether  the tree is real or not!)  Not surprising, there are few ornaments on the  trees, as they are scattered around the floor and kittens are chasing them.   There is a fireplace on one wall, with thousands of stockings hanging from it.   Strolling over, you notice they are all for various cats that reside on the  planet, and are full of catnip toys and playballs.   A buffet on another wall features tuna fish and cream.   Standing in the midst of this furor is a jolly cat-like Santa, who is busy  editing his list.  Hmm, were you a good little cat this year, Catspaws???</desc>
