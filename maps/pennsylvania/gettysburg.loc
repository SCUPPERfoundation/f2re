      <desc>The northern end of Longsteet&apos;s lines on the 2nd and 3rd of July, this is the location where General George Pickett&apos;s Virginia division began it&apos;s fateful charge on the 3rd. 12,000 Confederates set out from here across the field to the east. Not one of them made it to the Union defended stone wall on the other side and few made it back alive. It was the worst defeat Lee ever experienced and marked the end of any chance for a Confederate victory in the war.</desc>

      <desc>At 3:00 O clock three divisions, 12,000 men started out from the woods to the west toward the stone wall at a steady pace. They were silent as they marched. Forbidden this time to fire or even to give the &quot;Rebel Yell.&quot;</desc>
