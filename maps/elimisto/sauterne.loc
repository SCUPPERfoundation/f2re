Narrow dusty paths break off in several directions toward the north, but a barrier and several native guards prevent you from going any further.  Returning to the south is your only option.</desc>

      <name>The Club</name>
      <desc>  High above the main floor an exclusive dance club operates throughout the day and night.  You can&apos;t see any visible means with which this platform is held in place, but that could be due to the dark ambiance.  There is no railing around the edge, which could cause vertigo for anyone not used to heights.  Colorful flashes of lightning cut through the air following an invisible domed force field that encloses the platform.  A few strange statues and other abstract and alien works of art furnish the area, and are highlighted with dark blue, purple and black lighting.</desc>
      <desc>   Booths, tables and bars are strategically placed around the edges of the platform, while a large dance floor dominates the center.  Entities from all known worlds dance and party here drinking Juoma and enjoying the altering effects it has on them.</desc>

In the corners are large pots that hold very odd looking plants, shrubs and small trees.  It is refreshingly quiet here with the tinkling of a small water decoration adding to the relaxing atmosphere.  A receptionist sits behind an enclosure that uses most of the north wall.

A road leads off to the north and south from here, while toward the southwest you can see the edge of the vast chasm that can be seen from your shuttle upon landing.  The ground between you and the chasm consists of very dark purple, loose dirt.  A small number of shrubs and short twisted trees can be seen dotting the landscape.</desc>

Both a human and a Viinitarhan stand duty at an information booth that sits near an exit to the west.

They originate from the east and rise to alpine heights terminating on a platform that appears to be floating high above the main floor.  It is slightly quieter here than it is toward the south where venders vie for the prime locations near the airlock that leads to the shuttle dome.

The floor in this area has been raised a step up from the main floor.  It is a marble floor, creamy with shades of jade green swirling and snaking through it.</desc>

      <desc>  You are on a wide dirt road that is hard packed from many years of travel.  East of you is a staging area for the large airlock that serves as the receiving department for Bootlegger imports, where many carts and vats sit about on a polycrete pad.  Lines of carts stretch toward the south and wait on the east side of the road as the guards check credentials before allowing entry onto the lot.  A closer look at the huge elukka, pulling the carts, reveals that they look like a mixture of a camel and a wooly mammoth.  Viinitarhans drive the beasts while perched on top of the vats that they are delivering.</desc>

The beasts, known as elukka, stamp and snort but seem basically at ease.   The smooth floor is stained pink and green in areas and the smell of alcohol is strong.</desc>
      <desc>   At scheduled intervals the airlock cycles allowing those arriving and departing to do so.  The environment then stabilizes and full vats are moved to the east while empty ones are loaded onto empty carts to be taken away.  You can see a large staging area out on the planet&apos;s surface toward the west, but guards prevent all but employees of Bootlegger Exports and Viinitarhans on business from exiting in that direction.  Your only option is to retreat back to the east.</desc>

      <desc>   The smell of wood and wine is at its strongest here where a vast area of Terminus Main is used for storing vats of Juoma, Sauterne&apos;s famous wine.  Hundreds of vats, easily holding thousands of gallons of wine, are arranged here in rows.  Each vat has a large stylized tilted wine bottle and a goblet chiseled onto its side, which has then been inlayed with a golden substance.  The sound of marching guards fade in and out of earshot as they patrol the area heavily to prevent theft and vandalism.</desc>
      <desc>   To the west a large airlock cycles as many of Sauterne&apos;s natives enter with their carts to deliver the vats of wine, while to the east is the loud chattering of vendors and visitors.  Music occasionally can be heard drifting up from the south but to the north there seems to be less activity.</desc>

      <desc>   The Terminus Main is a vast clear dome that seems to be mostly open with vendor stalls placed here and there to create walkways of sorts.  A platform floats high above, the open edges revealing little due to the extreme height.  The bustling about of hundreds of people buying and selling, bickering and bartering, make it difficult to hear much else, but from the east the occasional banging and clanking of tools rise above the general din.</desc>
      <desc>   Occasionally a brawl breaks out which the terminus security guards rush to quell, any injured or dead being hustled off toward the north.</desc>
      <desc>   Many different aromas waft about; some pleasant, others not so much.  The strong smell of wood and wine sometimes drifts in from the west where guards purposefully stalk through an expanse of huge wooden vats.  A group of visitors stumble by from the southeast in an obvious drunken stupor.</desc>

Behind a long grease-stained counter a harried looking man with greasy black unkempt hair attempts to deal with several customers at once.  &quot;I&apos;ll be right with you!&quot; he yells over their heads.  A tag on his non-descript grey coveralls indicates that his name is James.</desc>

Large wooden poles, apparently imported, support a sturdy wooden roof.  Wooden tables ring the perimeter among the support poles, and there are smaller cozier tables under the roof itself.  A few of the native Viinitarhans stand behind the circular center bar serving Juoma, the native wine, and a wide variety of other drinks.</desc>
      <desc>   Many questionable looking people sit in groups at different tables talking and laughing raucously as a strange music emanates from strategically placed and invisible speakers.

It is dry and harsh, seemingly inhospitable to any life form.  Upon closer inspection however, small spindly shrubs and alien plants can be seen dotting the arid desert environment.  Dust devils twist above the ground drawing oddly dark purple dust into the sky.  Toward the west is the lip of a gargantuan chasm, a simple dirt road winding along the edge.  On the road a line of strange-looking animals pull what appear to be huge vats or kegs on wheels.</desc>
