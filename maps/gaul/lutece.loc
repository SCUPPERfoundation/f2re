      <desc>Merepoule commissioned archeologists and archivists to collect objects, documents and artwork relating to the original Lutece on Earth.  As you proceed through the exhibit, you learn that Lutece had been founded by the Gallic people, who eventually constructed a large city based on Earth&apos;s Rome, including aqueducts, arenas, an ampitheater, public baths and large monuments.  It eventually became known as Paris.  One of the chemical elements in the periodic table is called Lutetium, since it was discovered in a Paris laboratory on Earth.
