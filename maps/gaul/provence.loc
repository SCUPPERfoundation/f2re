      <name>The Summit</name>
      <desc>You have reached the summit.  The air is thin and it takes a few minutes for your lightheadedness to pass.  A railing has been erected near the vertical drops to prevent a careless tourist from slipping on loose gravel and falling down the cliffs.  As you adjust and your heart stops pounding, you take in the magnificent scenery.  Taller peaks are visible, disappearing into the clouds towards the north.  From this height you can view the sea to the south, its color more muted, the curving line of the shore appearing maplike.  Down the other side of the mountain is a cog railway leading down to a village to the north.  It&apos;s closed for the season, so you must face the cable car ride once again to return.  You notice a spartan food and drink stand tucked near the cable car platform.  It might be easier to ride the cable car down again on a full stomach, even if it&apos;s just a sandwich and a bottle of water.</desc>
      <desc>To return, go IN the cable car.</desc>

      <name>Cable Car</name>
      <desc>You stand in the cable car, your hands latched onto the center pole to keep your balance as it swings.  You look down - once - and vertigo strikes you immediately as you see yourself suspended hundreds of feet above the ground and still gliding quickly along the cable.  You turn your eyes to your destination and fix them onto the landing platform which you are slowly approaching.  Each time the cable car crosses a support post it rumbles, then lurches and your stomach seems left behind.  You begin to feel lightheaded and are anxious to exit this cable car.  Finally, it slows its approach and gently eases into its landing platform.  You are eager to get OUT at the top, but if you are on your return trip, watch your step DOWN as you exit.</desc>

      <desc>Your eyes adjust to the dark and you realize it would have been wise to bring some outerwear because it&apos;s definitely cooler.  You hear a tinkling sound of water dripping and the ground is damp.  The floor of this grotto entrance is uneven, slanting this way and that, and the wetness makes it slippery.  You wonder how easy it will be to manoeuver further into the cave and check the lantern you had the foresight to bring.  You did bring a lantern, right?</desc>
      <desc>The entrance to the cave is blocked by a barricade and a sign which reads:  Provence has declared this cave too dangerous until appropriate safety measures have been installed.</desc>

Indeed they are topped with snow in the winter months, but in summer that illusion persists because they are made of limestone and devoid of vegetation above a certain altitude.  You see chalets with colorful window boxes of flowers and cows grazing in the meadows, the bells around their necks clanging as they move.</desc>

Juniper trees line the road interspersed with wild sage, rosemary and thyme.  You pause for a farmer blocking your path as he herds his flock of sheep to a grassy meadow.

One in particular has a place of honor depicting her grandmother as a young woman ambling through a field of lavender.  In the corner is a piano which has livened up parties on many occasions.  On the piano is a photograph framed in silver of her beloved Jfour.  Bouquets of fresh flowers are scattered in the room and the white macrame lace curtains permit the sunlight to brighten the room.

The floor is made of traditional Provencal hexagonal red tile.  Hanging from the ceiling over a large central workspace are shiny brass cooking pots of every shape and size.  A back door leads to a walled garden.  By the door suspended from the ceiling are numerous bunches of drying herbs and strings of garlic.  In the farthest corner from the stove, thoughtfully placed between two windows providing a cooling cross current is a large oak farm-style table, covered with a cloth in a traditional Provencal pattern, a background of blue with bright gold lemons.  On the six-burner stove is a bubbling casserole of cassoulet, a rich bean stew with pork.  If you&apos;re hungry, please have some.  A door leads south to the family room.</desc>

One quadrant is given over to herbs and a few fresh plantings of tomatoes and beans.  Another fourth of the land is comprised of a minature formal garden with carefully tended topiary shrubs sculptured into fleurs de lys patterns.  Garden tools are discreetly stacked beside a small wooden supply shed.  A third area is devoted to a profusion of colorful and fragrant flowers which clearly stocks the several vases of flowers in each of the rooms in the villa.  Among the most colorful are the poppies, hyacinths, bougainvillia and hibiscus.  Finally, in a corner sheltered by the stone wall is a charming gazebo with vines climbing up its sides.

You realize that some have been designed by leading artists.  In other shops you see the finest, most translucent porcelain, entire dinner services hand painted with gilt edges. As you meander among the shops you are amazed at the variety ranging from vases and serving bowls to tiled house signs and objets d&apos;art.  You spot an unusual umbrella stand, the design tiny umbrellas in gold on a blue background, again traditional Provencal colors.

Finally you see wide docks housing luxurious yachts, their crews cleaning and readying those vessels for their owners.  Some distance away the really large yachts are anchored and further out still an ocean liner also awaits the return of its passengers.  A boat terminal is west where you can board ferries to the islands offshore.  >From there you will also find a shipyard as well as a ship repair yard.</desc>

      <name>Croisette Leading to Casino and Old Town</name>
      <desc>The Croisette continues here.  Towards the water&apos;s edge is a magnificent marble building that looks palatial in its dimensions.  This is the Provence Casino where fortunes are gambled away and where people gather to be seen and to catch glimpses of celebrities.  You can try your luck by going IN.  A cobblestone road stretches northwest towards the oldest part of Provence.  West you can see the port.</desc>
      <desc>East takes you along the Croisette and back towards Provence&apos;s Landing Pad.</desc>

      <desc>You walk along the cobblestone and are rewarded with a splendid view.  The sun shines brilliantly here as you see the long beach spread out before you.  The Croisette is a wide walkway running the length of the shore.  Stone steps lead down to the individual beaches where bright sun umbrellas line up in several rows next to matching chaises.  The turquoise waters glisten and children sit at the edge, waves lapping at their toes as they build their sand castles.  Little bistros are tucked in the rear of each beach offering delightful food and plentiful local wine.  As you gaze down the length of the Croisette you see marvelous hotels lined up like royal luminaries, their columns, turrets and grandiose entrances competing for admiration.  There are steps leading DOWN to the Voilier Beach or you can stroll east or west along the Croisette.  The hospital is to the west.</desc>

      <name>The Croisette and Carousel</name>
      <desc>The wide promenade continues and you notice that the hotels along this stretch appear to be the most elegant.  As you look ahead the beach curves around and is so long you can&apos;t see the end of it.  Each beach has its own signature design umbrellas so as you look down the beach you see rectangular patches of blue, red, yellow, white or green.  Wealthy people stroll down the Croisette wearing their avant-garde fashions with artful casualness.  You hear a merry circus melody and see a carousel with painted ponies.  The children are squealing in excitement, leaning forward, outstretched hands holding sticks to grab the gold loop which will entitle them to a free ride.</desc>

      <desc>Continuing down the main promenade along the beach you come to an immense circular manmade pond.  Children kneel all around its edges, remote controllers in hand as they steer their boats, squealing in dismay at collisions that capsize their toys.  Parents stand by, ready to wade in to rescue a child&apos;s sunken craft.  The beaches in this area are public beaches, the mattresses scattered willy nilly mocking the tidy rows of the private beaches on either side.  Along the water&apos;s edge in this area you can find pleasure craft for hire.  Vendors circulate selling candied peanuts.  Palm trees abound in this area and you see a park you can reach if you continue southeast.</desc>

Women adorned in sparkling gems dressed in exquisite gowns yell for their numbers to come up on the roulette wheel.  Men in silk dinner jackets drinking aged cognac attempt to mask their emotions at the baccarat tables.  Dice are rolling, and chips are being raked in everywhere one looks.  Portraits are framed in gold leaf of former wagerers from royal families who now gaze down upon the gamblers with a certain look of disapproval.</desc>

      <desc>Tiny little tables are crammed into a strip of sand at the back of the beach.  The kitchen is tucked under the Croisette itself.  Somehow, the staff manages to prepare first class food for the beachgoers, although many patrons are drifting down from the Croisette itself, focused on the delightful fare and not the beach&apos;s pleasures.  The specialties of the day are chalked on a blackboard, featuring Salade Nicoise, Sole Meuniere and Bouillabaisse.  The local rose wines are refreshing and worth trying.  The view of the sea brings contentment and the sound of the waves lapping on the shore relaxes you.  You can go OUT to return to the beach.</desc>

      <desc>A delightful public park entices you to sit for awhile and watch the waves roll in.  Mature palm trees shade you and you see quite a few green metal chairs scattered around, many vacant.  You are surprised to see an old woman, her back bent over from her years, going to each occupied chair and speaking with the occupants.  You see her taking money and shake your head at her having to beg until she comes to you, flashing her badge announcing &quot;I am with the Provence Park Commission.  We maintain this park by charging for the chairs.  100 groats if you please.&quot;</desc>

The translucent blue-green water looks inviting.  On one corner of the beach are some pedal boats and sailfish for rent.  Above the beach facing the sea looms the Majestic Hotel, its art deco design and pristine white exterior beckoning the privileged who can afford it.  You can go IN the small bistro at the back of the beach if you&apos;re hungry or thirsty.  You can go up to return to the Croisette.</desc>

Apparently these Cistercian monks keep busy.  As you proceed up the hill towards the monastery, you see grapevines being cultivated in every direction.</desc>

Small boats are scattered around them and it looks like people visit for the day, picnicking and swimming away from the crowded Provence beaches.  A profusion of parasailers and water skiers are swirling between Ste. Marguerite and St. Honorat.</desc>
      <desc>This island housed the Lero Fort and Prison and the prison contained some controversial inmates including the Man in the Iron Mask.  The prison is now part of a museum and can be visited by continuing south.</desc>

      <desc>Huffing from the long climb, you catch your breath and inspect the monastery.  Its design is stark and unadorned and yet the monks you see around you have beatific smiles.  The tourguide explains that the monastery was originally on the site of ruins that can be seen on the sea&apos;s edge.  He speaks of ancient shipwrecks from which ceramics and coins have been recovered and are on display in the small museum.  As the monks pass around you, you can hear some of them whistling and many have rosy cheeks and noses.  You see a sign by a small stone structure which reads:  St. Honorat Cellars - tastings available.  A few steps lead UP into the cellar.</desc>

A small group clusters around a guide who explains what will be seen.  &quot;Don&apos;t forget to visit our souvenir shop at the end of the tour.  Refreshments are also available there.&quot;  He continues, &quot;This prison was built to house upper class prisoners.  Strict confinement was unnecessary because they could not escape the island, so they were allowed servants as befitted them and could wander the island.&quot;  The guide clears his throat and announces very dramatically, &quot;...the exception of course being the infamous Man in the Iron Mask.&quot;  Let&apos;s go IN his cell now and learn about him.</desc>

      <desc>The wine and brandies produced by the monks is exhibited on mahogany shelves lining the walls.  The labels on all the bottles show a smiling monk on a hill, the blue-green sea in the background.  One rotund friendly monk with sparkling eyes is explaining the process, emphasizing how the St. Honorat wines and spirits are made in time-honored fashion, rejecting more modern processing techniques.  His deep powerful voice explains that brandy is produced by distilling wine, then aging it in wooden casks.  &quot;These are kept beneath us here in our cellars,&quot; he adds.</desc>
      <desc>A few plain wooden stools are placed before a tall counter and another monk has poured flights of wine for you to sample.  You need some stamina after that long climb up to the monastery.  You can go OUT to the monastery.</desc>

      <name>Prison Cell</name>
      <desc>The cell you have entered is large but has an odd feature.  It has multiple iron doors, and when the prisoner was in the cell, the doors could be closed and locked successively one after another upon themselves.  It is clear that the intention was to complete isolate whomever was imprisoned here.  There are several versions of the legend surrounding this prisoner, but all agree his identity was kept hidden by requiring him to wear an Iron Mask when being transported or whenever he might be exposed to anyone else, prisoner or jailer.  Speculation from the greatest writers of the time was that he was an older brother of a king, denied his rightful throne.  Others conjectured that he was a nobleman imprisoned from England.  One thing is certain, such a prisoner existed for the Iron Mask sits on the scratched and flimsy wooden table right in this cell.  You examine this frightful mask and shudder to think of having to wear such a thing.  You need to get OUT.</desc>
