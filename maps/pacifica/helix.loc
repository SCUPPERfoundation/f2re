      <name>Transcription Terminator</name>
      <desc>  The Transcription Terminator is the main ground transportation hub for the helix.  You can see many identical copies of vechiles being completed here.  Further in the distance you can see cargo trucks moving back and forth.</desc>

      <desc>   The enzyme transfer point is a cargo passage connecting the ground vehicle hub to the heavy lifter launch point in the distance.  You can&apos;t do much here... except watch crates of various sizes recede into the distance sliding quickly along automated conveyors.</desc>

      <name>RNA Bar</name>
      <desc>   The RNA bar is a scant little pub on the dirty end of Helix.  Hard working transportation chiefs and loaders stop in for &quot;beer-thirty&quot; specials- that&apos;s specials on the half hour.</desc>
      <desc>   Scotty the bartender mutters something about not having enough power and pours you a fresh drink.</desc>

      <name>Double Helix Reception</name>
      <desc>   You are standing at the absolute middle of the Double Helix, in the reception area.  This grand room is a huge glass bubble - several stories high.  The most amazing sight is the cluster of transport tubes that take visitors Up to the landing point.</desc>
      <desc>  Through the glass and steel frame, you can see the lush forests and expansive fields of the Helix.  There are curved glass corridors heading offset 45 degrees from each of the main compass points.</desc>

      <desc>   The Genome Exchange is a place where only the fittest traders survive.  The whole place looks like a 20th century casino.  There are lots of electronic displays and tickers.  Grab a terminal and do your business!</desc>

      <name>Nucleus Office Complex</name>
      <desc>   The lobby of the Nucleus office complex is small but ornate.  The room seems larger due to the waterfall that cascades down from the third floor, splashing behind the security desk.  You can head Up to the offices floor using the escalators.</desc>

      <name>Mitochondria Bar</name>
      <desc>   The Mitochondria Bar is slightly more upscale than the dive on the North side of Helix.  Though it&apos;s not the best place to eat or drink nearby.  Mostly catering to space combat fans and Double Ball watchers, it sports huge viewscreens on every inch of available wall.</desc>
      <desc>   The booths are ratty and the beer is watered down, but this place isn&apos;t about quality- it&apos;s about quantity.  Heavy drinkers only need apply.</desc>

      <name>Rick&apos;s Office</name>
      <desc>   Rick&apos;s office is sparsely decorated.  Having suffered several suspicious bankruptcies, he has been under scrutiny as a criminal syndicate member in several sectors.  Charges ranging from money laundering to illicit substance manufacturing just never seem to stick.</desc>
      <desc>   The front wall is a single pane of engineered glass.  There are 3 classic paintings hanging behind the desk on the back wall.</desc>

      <desc>   &quot;Can I help you,&quot; asks the android secretary?  Knowing you&apos;ll need a meeting, you should probably decide to head Up to the cafe, or make your way back Down to the ground level.  Security won&apos;t look kindly on you intruding into the private offices.</desc>

      <name>Rooftop Cafe</name>
      <desc>   The Rooftop Cafe at the top of the Nucleus Offices is the most exclusive eatery in the system.  A shame really- because most people come for the drinks!  The outdoor atmosphere is wonderful with chinese lanterns hanging between secluded gazebos.</desc>
      <desc>   Several couches are lined facing the expansive vistas.  You can watch the game run and the predators hunt as you enjoy your cocktails.</desc>

      <name>Smitty&apos;s Office</name>
      <desc>   Smitty has offices all over the system, but this one is where he spends the least of his time.  Mostly because he works from the cafe on the roof.  He has also deferred planetary management to Rick, whose office is on the West face of the building.</desc>
      <desc>   There&apos;s a comfortable chair facing the windows, with a side table housing a remote terminal link and projection glasses.  Otherwise, the only decoration is the small bar in the corner.</desc>
