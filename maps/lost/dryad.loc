      <desc>Candles dance in the wind as you stand before the awesome Altar of the Goddess. Lavender incense fills the air, intoxicating to your senses. Almost swooning, you look up to a statue of the Goddess, and the thought occurs to you....you&apos;ve seen that face before, but you can&apos;t quite place it. Glancing at the ritual knife lying on the altar, you see what seems to be drops of blood. The worship area is back to the south.</desc>

Garlands of sheer gold hang from the rafters, adding a soft glow to the candle lit worship area. The Dryad goddesses worship the Ultimate Goddess, the creator of the universe. Her likeness, in gold, hangs above the door leading out onto the roadway. Pews stand in rows, and are filled with hundreds of Dryad goddesses waiting for the next celebration ritual to begin. Doors lead out from the worship area to the east and west.</desc>

You can see a large hunk of twisted metal in the center, and it dawns on you that this must be the original crash site, presevered by the goddesses as a sacred place.</desc>
      <desc>     Suddenly, a small dark goddess slips up beside you, hardly making a sound. &quot;Beware sweet traveler,&quot; she whispers, &quot;Many have become lost in our forest, and never heard from again.&quot; She smiles at you as she trails her fingers across your cheek. You blink, and she is gone, the faint smell of her lavender scented hair a memory. You look around, and can not see any foot prints from her departure, making you wonder if it was all a dream.</desc>

Wandering through the star systems lost, the ship finally malfunctioned and crash landed on a planet in a system far from the Milky Way.

Heaps of half burned kindling lie around the base of the stump. The quiet figure of a goddess sits before the tree, in what appears to be deep mourning. Quietly she begins to speak.</desc>
      <desc>     &quot;When we are born, we are tied to the tree of our birth. We live as long as our tree does. If our tree thrives, so do we. If our tree sickens and dies, so do we. Some fear a strong tree, because it makes a strong goddess.&quot; The quiet goddess looks skyward and sighs. &quot;She was beautiful, tall, so full of life. A strong one, with arms stretched toward the heavens. And of course, that was her downfall.&quot;</desc>

      <desc>     Back in the dark ages of space travel, Earth was being crushed under the weight of over-population. Scientists, world leaders, and star-gazers turned their eyes toward the heavens in the hope of finding planets that would be able to support human life and ease the crowding masses on Earth.</desc>
      <desc>     Activist groups, religious factions, and whole countries launched campaigns, trying to be chosen to man one of the first colony ships that were leaving in search of a new world. The scientists won out, and began gathering a team of some several thousand men and women, with backgrounds in genetics, gene-manipulation, bio-engineering, and space flight, not to mention with strong genetic profiles. The idea was that if a planet was found, either the enviroment could be adapted, or the population could.</desc>

      <desc>The scientists came up with a last ditch effort to help their struggling colony. To genetically alter the human genes, splicing them with the DNA of the strong trees they had brought to the planet with them....oaks, redwoods, even the soft willow. This meant the next generation of children born into the colony could expect longer life, stronger constitutions, and a resistance to disease. But the manipulations also had a drastic, unforseen effect.</desc>
      <desc>     From that moment on, all the children born into the colony were female, with special senses that tied them to the trees they were combined with. As they grew, other qualities became apparent. The new species of human no longer needed males for procreation......</desc>

Yards of golden satin screen the bed from view, while golden candles cover almost every surface in the room, including the bookcases filled with ancient texts. You glance at the volumes, and one title catches your eye...&quot;Feeding Your Inner Goddess: A guide for the modern Goddess and Sacrifices.&quot; The faint scent of lavender fills your senses, making your head swoon.

About halfway down you pass a sign that reads &quot;Slippery When Frozen!&quot; The slope curves around in a circle, and as you gain speed, you get almost upside down as you zoom down the slippery surface. Dead ahead of you, you see the waterfall and the deep pool, and you realize that is where you will come out at.</desc>

A large sign above the screens informs you that Dryad welcomes all commerce, but limits it&apos;s factories to invitation only. If you would like a factory on Dryad, be sure to contact Jessecka. Otherwise, it will be removed by force. The exit to the Landing Facility is to the northeast.</desc>

Quietly, droids circle the room, taking orders, and making sure the patrons have plenty to drink. The coolness and quiet of the bar washes over you, helping you to relax. Shining brightly, a long bar stretches out along the wall, with a real human bartender wiping it down with a soft cloth rag. The bartender smiles at you before going back to her job. She is a stunning Dryad goddess, with golden skin and long dark hair. Over to the side you see a large window, showing a beautiful picture of the planet Dryad as it spins slowly on its axis. The exit to the landing area is to the north.</desc>

It looks like someone has been using the river as an ice skating area, with deep groves carved in the surface from ice skates. You notice a lone pair of ice skates to one side, inviting you to jump on in, and have some fun. The path leads off to the east, while the main roadway is back up the side of the riverbank. You feel like you are being watched by the forest around you, whispers in the wind. You shiver and pull the fur parka closer to your body. In the distance to the east, you see the river swing into a bend, and you are unable to see any farther.</desc>

A tall table, complete on top with a small table, chairs and a couch, sits to one side, ready for any mice who want to be eye level with their friends. Dryad goddesses circle the room, taking drink orders and serving food. A very beautiful Dryad goddess stands in the back beside a table, ready to give any who need it a pleasent back massage.
