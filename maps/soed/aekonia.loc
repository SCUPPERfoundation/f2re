      <desc>O&apos;Kole&apos;s Saloon is a bar where you can drink until you fall on your okole.  The bar is lined with dark wood, and a cloud of stale smoke hangs like a cloud over the patrons&apos; heads.  As you walk in, you feel all eye&apos;s turn to size you up, and then turn away with a shrug, as if you are not worth neglecting the important task at hand.  And the tools available to assist the patrons with this task are varied.  There are Deosian Sweet Wines, and whiskey imported from Ainokea.  One sip of this whiskey,and the drinker says with a satisfied smile, &quot;Ainokea.&quot;  There are dart boards and video game units to amuse the patrons while they sample the many fine ales and liquors.  On the shelf you even see from Aliment a bottle of their finest Takillya.  This is a bar made for wasting away long hours and quietly drinking until you  are flat on your okole.</desc>

      <name>Che Zippe Restaurant</name>
      <desc>Chez Zippe is renowned for its cuisine.  In fact, Extraterrestrial Psychology Today credited it with the creation of a new condition, the Edible Complex, The Head Chef, Octugaran the Obese, is a seven armed mollusk, who by using his arms simultaneously, is able to create dishes with flavors that take the diner to levels of pleasure that border on orgasmic.  Octugaran once had eight arms, but on a busy night, with five arms busy chopping ingredients for a visiting party of distinguished gourmands and restaurant critics, a knife slipped and sliced off one of Octugaran&apos;s arms.  The arm fell onto a steaming platter of noodles just as it was carried out the door to be served to the guests.  The rave reviews that followed resulted in the creation of a new dish that is served each time Octugaran regenerates an arm.  Customers flock from all over the galaxy to dine at the table of the Chef that puts more of himself into the dishes than any other.  To the north is a private table.</desc>

In the center of the room on a black tray is an unusually designed tea set of glazed celadon pottery.  The tea set at first looks crude and simple, but as you gaze at it from different angles, you see that the artist created through the use of different glazes, the effect that it changes color.  You realize that the tea set is actually quite sophisticated.  In this Teahouse, Zard and Sephy come to relax and quietly think of the complexities of life, that lie beneath the simple explanation.</desc>

      <desc>The bathhouse is lined with fine grained Aekonian Hardwood that has been stained a golden brown.  In the center of the room are two tubs.  The tubs are placed in such away that the users would be sitting next to and facing the opposite direction of each other.  This arrangement was chosen to accomodate Seph.  Since she is a Strom, she is used to temperatures far in excess of that which Zard could endure.  By having two tubs, Zard and Seph can take their evening baths together, hold hands, and talk, and both enjoy a water temperature that is to their comfort and enjoyment.  There are soft robes and towels hanging from wooden pegs on the wall.</desc>

      <name>Zard and Sephy&apos;s Tea Garden</name>
      <desc>Zard and Sephy&apos;s house surrounds a small Japanese garden.  The garden is constantly attended to by garden droids, and there is not even one leaf that is out of place.  The dark green of the garden contrasts with the white shoji doors of the house and the effect is to magnify the sense of greenery and nature in the garden.  Bamboo screens are strategically placed to partition areas of the garden so that one must take the time to pause and reflect with each step.  Clearly this is a place designed to slow one&apos;s mood, and relax one&apos;s mind.  To the north is a small Tea House.</desc>

      <desc>When Zard received the title to this land, he commissioned architects and builders to build this house right away.  He instructed them to build one room for the exclusive use of his bride, Sephorin.  Zard has always adored Seph&apos;s artwork.  Seph is one of the finest wordsmiths in Fed and can craft beautiful images with just words.  Zard set this room for her to work and create her beautiful images.  The room has a tatami mat floor and an easel is set up on one side.  There are watercolors and inks available for Seph to work with.  The shoji doors open on the west, east, and north sides to provide inspirational views of the gardens.  In the center of the room, on a white silk handkerchief, is a long-stemmed red rose and a note.  The note says, &quot;For my lovely wife, who I so adore, I will forever be yours, Zardoz&quot;.</desc>

On one night stand, in a silver frame, is a picture of Sephorin on her wedding day.  The pillows are in sufficient number for creating comfortable sitting positions for the mornings that Zard and Sephy want to spend time together, and allow them to conduct their business side by side, while never leaving the bedroom.</desc>

The living area is sparsely decorated reflecting its ability to be used in a variety of situations.  The walls are decorated with some fine examples of calligraphy and some water color landscapes.  There is some soft music playing, and panels can be moved to provide computer displays so Zard and Sephy can work, while they relax at home with each other.  There are rooms to the east and west, as well as a garden to the north.</desc>

      <desc>Zard and Sephy have positioned their desks so they face each other.  This gives them the chance to talk and plan together as they conduct their business.  They used to have the desks side by side, but Sephy told Zard that his constant kisses were making her lose her concentration, so they settled on the present arrangement.  Actually, Zard will be the first to admit that he prefers this arrangement.  Zard has always enjoyed not only his wife&apos;s beauty, but her wit and intelligence as well.  Zard has said that by working with Sephy, he makes better decisions, because she brings a level of skills and insight that he totally lacks.  On the wall are pictures of Zard and Sephy from their wedding, and in a glass case, a small girl devil doll is on display.</desc>
