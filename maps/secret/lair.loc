      <name>Top of Doomsday Device</name>
      <desc>   You are standing at the very top of the machine, which is featureless except for the large construct resembling a radar dish.  It is a broad, deep dish made of a shiny silver metal, with a single, thick, black antenna jutting from the center, pointing straight up towards the ceiling of the cavern.  Surveying the ceiling, you note many huge steel support beams and runners that have been built directly into the roof of the cavern, as well as a wide pattern of obviously man-made seams in the rock.  The ladder back down into the control room is at your feet.</desc>

A large screen dominates the far wall, displaying an indecipherable and ever-changing stream of data.  Two sections of the screen draw your eye.  The first shows an equation: Gab=8piTab.  Both Gab and Tab have spaces to display values, but at this time no values are shown.  The other section holds another equation: s2=r2-c2t2.  Each of s2, r2 and t2 also have spaces to display values, which spaces show a constantly-changing array of numbers.</desc>

      <desc>   You are standing on a landing opening out into an enormous underground cavern pockmarked with roiling pools of magma.  In the middle of the cavern stands a huge machine, the size of a multi-story building, with a large object that appears to be some sort of radar dish attached to the top, pointing upwards.  Large cables and pipes giving off thick white steam extrude from the machine&apos;s base, running off in all directions before ultimately disappearing into the floor or walls of the cavern.  The very air of the cavern hums and crackles with energy.</desc>
      <desc>   The cavern itself is a beehive of activity, with many individuals in long white coats entering and exiting the machine through a small doorway in its base, under the constant watchful eye of heavily-armed functionaries.  It seems you have not been noticed in the bustle - you likely could make your way down the staircase at the edge of the landing or, if you are fortunate, slip inside the machine yourself.</desc>

Several windows are mounted in the chamber.  Looking through one, you see, at the center of the chamber, a large torus of dark, viscous liquid, seemingly floating in midair, rotating at a rapid rate.  At the center of the torus is a bright silver cube, also seemingly floating in midair and also rotating rapidly, though in the opposite direction of the torus.</desc>
      <desc>   &quot;It was the breakthrough in diamagnetism that did it,&quot; you overhear one white-coated man say to another.  &quot;Perfecting the superconductive magnet through cryogenics not only gave us the gravity generation we were looking for, it also allowed for the creation, stabilization and control of the neutronium, which can certainly push us past the gravitation tipping point.&quot;  The two men continue their conversation as they ascend a set of stairs to the second floor.</desc>

There is a narrow rock ledge that runs around the perimeter of the chamber, but no other visible exit from the natural rock cavern other than the door to the south.  Along the north shore of the lagoon are moored various marine vehicles, such as boats, high-speed one-man water scooters, as well as what appears to be a sizeable submarine.  However, it is unclear how these vehicles got in this chamber, or how they would get out, as there does not seem to be a navigable water exit.  A handful of functionaries tend to the various ships without taking notice of your presence.</desc>

The scientists in that area are clearly working on mapping the slithy tove DNA, with an eye towards cloning.  Obviously any group that cracks the genetic code of those prized animals will have a license to print groats.  Meanwhile, an ungodly howl draws your attention to a different area of the lab, where a couple of scientists are conducting torturous experiments on several small cats.

As you stand there attempting to accustom your hearing to the cacophany of gunshots, explosions and other noises of destruction, you are shocked by the sound of a screeching howl from a nearby station.  In the station stands an individual with an odd shoulder-mounted cannon firing a strange blue ray at the target at the end of the range.  As you continue to watch, the target begins to shimmer and shake, finally exploding in a blinding blue light with a resounding &quot;POP!&quot;  As your vision clears, you note that the target is no longer there.  Instead, it has been replaced by... a clucking chicken.  These people indeed have access to some strange and nefarious weapons.</desc>

      <desc>   The dim lighting provided by a few flickering torches set in the walls casts this room in shadows that obscure its contents.  As your eyes adjust to the darkness, it becomes apparent that this is a storage chamber for a huge number and wide variety of marital aids, adult toys, appliances and other instruments that would cause Dr. Fogg himself to blanch.  These items are generally mounted along the walls or set in display cases.  There are also large wardrobes that hold various items of clothing, costumes, and other props and accessories.  Cabinets hold a plethora of oils, lotions and fragrances.  In one corner are swatches and bolts of numerous fabrics, from the softest satins to the roughest hopsacks.  Another corner is set aside solely for hot and cold foodstuffs and the means to prepare them.  Locked chests hold secrets you may never learn.</desc>
      <desc>   There are doorways to the north, south, east and west and a hallway leading up out of the bowels of the volcano.</desc>

The room itself is decorated in sundry shades of red, with swaths of various types of red-toned cloth adorning the room.  These swaths are of varying textures and are strung about the room, hanging from the ceiling, stretching from wall to wall, ceiling to wall, or wall to floor, the result of which is to inexorably draw one&apos;s attention to the bed.  It is an enormous, four-poster canopy bed with curtains adorned with large, fluffy pillows and smooth satin sheets.  At each of the four corners are restraints made from the various fabrics decorating the room.  On the floor to one side of the bed is a large vase holding a wide variety of feathers and flowers.  On the other is a low table holding vials of scented and flavored oils and lotions.  Finally, at the foot of the bed is a low, padded-leather bench.</desc>

Turning your attention to the south, you see an enormous blue ocean stretching off into the horizon.  Numerous seagulls are just barely visible soaring along the ocean zephyrs as the light of the setting sun reflects off of the calm, blue waters.

Each of the buildings, especially the armories, appear to be heavily guarded; it would be foolish to try to enter any of them.  In addition to the random hustle and bustle to be found in this area, occasionally a squad of troops march into the open muster area, where they, along with their equipment, are inspected by a commanding officer before being marched off to the staging area to the west.</desc>
      <desc>   Suddenly, the echoes of a loud explosion reverberate throughout the area!  Though none of the soldiers seem to take note of it, the unmistakable sounds of combat emanate from a large field to the south!</desc>

      <name>Cliff</name>
      <desc>   You are standing at the top of a giant cliff overlooking a calm, blue ocean that stretches as far as the eye can see.  A quick scan of the horizon turns up nothing but the occasional gull, soaring peacefully and effortlessly along the gentle ocean zephyrs.  The tropical rain forest that seems to cover every inch of dry land on this planet has advanced almost to the very edge of the cliff and is impassable in all directions except for a dirt path sloping uphill to the northwest.  A treacherous path leads down the cliff to what appears to be a beach far below.</desc>

      <name>Sea Cave</name>
      <desc>  You are floating in an enormous cave carved out of the side of the cliff by the slow and steady erosion of the mountainside by the sea water.  The water itself is so clear, it appears the bottom is only a couple of feet below the surface, when really you know it is many, many meters deeper than that.  Enormous stalactites reach down from the ceiling of the cave like countless large, ghoulish fingers.  The walls of the cave come straight down to the edge of the water, providing no landing or handhold to permit you to climb out onto dry land.  A quick scan reveals a small island to the north end of the cave, but no discernable exits other than out the cave entrance to the inlet.</desc>

      <name>Combat Exercise Range</name>
      <desc>It seems you have blundered right into the middile of a huge, violent battle! Heavily armored vehicles surge into the battle as foot soldiers scramble along behind. Large, airborne troop transports coordinate the landing and disgorgement of their shock troops into the battle, as smaller combat drones buzz overhead providing covering fire. The air around you crackles and hums from the energy weapons being discharged back and forth, occasionally punctuated by ground-shaking explosions. Suddenly, a shower of energy bursts rains from above, presumably from orbiting warships, and the sudden wave of heat knocks you to the ground as certain targets, as well as parts of the atmosphere, are converted into plasma. Huge static artillery units return fire, launching a volley of fiery destruction into the sky. As you consider beating a hasty retreat, you note that each soldier, vehicle and piece of equipment is emblazoned with the same black-and-gold vortex.</desc>

This appears to be the source of the inlet, as the water laps gently against a sheer cliff face to the north; however, upon further inspection you note a large sea cave carved deep into the side of the cliff into which you could swim, if you so desired.</desc>

      <desc>  The rocky path continues up the side of the cliff and down to the white sand beach visible below you.  The footing is extraordinarily perilous here, as the path threatens to give way under your feet with each step.  In addition, the wind has picked up, threatening to blow you off the side of the cliff itself.  It would not be wise to tarry at this point on the path.</desc>

To the north it appears the inlet terminates against a sheer cliff wall.  The inlet is otherwise bordered by impassable jungle on the east and west.</desc>

      <desc>  You are standing on a fine, white sand beach that stretches off to the east and is framed by an impassable cliff to the north and the sea to the south.  The sand is smooth and undisturbed, marked only by your own footprints.  Surveying the scene, you see nary a single ship on the sea or sky as far as your eye can see.  The salty sea air swirls calmly around you, and you would consider pausing a moment to relax and enjoy the scene if you didn&apos;t have a strange feeling that you are being watched.  Another quick scan of the area, however, turns up only the idyllic scenery and nothing, and no one, else.</desc>

      <name>Beach</name>
      <desc>   You are standing on a pristine white sand beach stretching out to the west in the distance.  A great cliff wall borders the beach to the north, but as you look along the cliff from the west to the east, you note that erosion has worn down the cliff until it has been reduced from a sheer rock wall in the northwest to a gentle sloping hill that has been overcome by thick rainforest in the northeast.  The beach is cut off abruptly to the east by an inlet that stretches northward out of view into the jungle.  As you scan the edge of the rainforest, a flash of color catches your eye: a simple, orange rubber raft lies partially concealed under the tropical undergrowth.  There is no sign of anyone or anything else.</desc>

      <desc>  You are floating in an inlet where it meets the sea.  The eastern bank is too steep for you to climb, but you could most likely climb out of the water onto a beach to the west.  The pounding ocean surf dissuades you from trying to head south out to sea, but you might be able to swim against the gentle current north along the stream into the jungle.  Then again, this is a strange and only slightly-explored planet - no one really knows what kind of life forms, aquatic or otherwise, exist here.</desc>
