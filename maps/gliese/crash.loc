      <desc>The Crash was the greatest single event ever to happen to the people of this planet.  Originally bound for a star only a few light years from Earth, the people were put in an extended state of unconcious hibernation.  When emergency failsafes awoke them, to their surprise they found themselves impossibly far off course, out of energy and in reach of only one habitable world.  Without sufficient resources to properly land due to unknown damage during the voyage, the captain chose to perform an unsanctioned manuver that successfully crash landed the ship, at the cost of his life and many others.  Those that survived would remember that day forever and commemorate the dead through the naming of the planet.</desc>

      <desc>Having lost many of the skilled technicians and educators that they originally left Earth with, many abandoned scientific progress as futile compared to what they had left behind.  Instead, they moved out into the rolling plains that surrounded the crash site, establishing disperate farming comunities and living off the land.  Those that chose to stay worked night and day to reestablish their mastery over the technology they had brought and the knowledge it contained.  For years the central repository of knowledge, the memory core stored in the core of the ship was inaccessable and thought destroyed.  None the less, a tireless and dedicated few pushed on, never accepting anything less than success, and eventually achieving it thanks to one man.</desc>
      <desc>Amber nudges you gently, &quot;Deklax, of course!  The next part of the exhibit is to the east. The Rebuilding&quot;</desc>

      <desc>With the memory core, Deklax was able to reshape the landscape of Crash in his own image, bringing the people back into a life of relative luxury and technical superiority over the lands around them.  Advanced manufacturing techniques passed down from Earth allowed the majority of labor to be done by machines while the crown jewel of advancements came as a primitive artificial intelligence.  Once it had been activated, its learning processes advanced with the tutelage of Deklax far beyond human comprehension. It took on the identity of its creator, absorbing the mental image of the man who had set it free from nothingness.  To this day it is our guiding controller of most computerized daily activities here, including the holograms.</desc>
      <desc>Amber smiles warmly at you, pointing toward the South, &quot;Deklax created the first Holographic construct that, in a way, I am based on.  I can thank him for my existence&quot;</desc>

      <desc>As part of the original settlement, this district is mostly constructed of various pieces of the ships that crash landed here.  Even the road is paved with a dense alloy extricated from ship hulls to simulate the environment everyone was used to as space travellers.  Far to the west a gleaming statue stands proudly over the city, looking down upon you.</desc>

      <desc>The first well to be dug after the Crash stands here to this day, surrounded by a transparent composite polymer that promises it surface eternal youth.  In the first years few things were more important than water, and this well tapped a spring of seemingly unlimited clean supply, allowing the settlement to flourish.  It appears as if the statue far to the west dominates the landscape, watching over the citizenry with benevolent grace.</desc>

      <desc>The Golden Hare Tavern was one of the first establishments to open after the Crash.  Every citizen of this planet can say they have frequented this haunting ground on one occasion or another.  On the walls brightly colored paintings of popular foods and beverages adorn a merry scene of enjoyment of dionysian proportions.</desc>

      <desc>Having been stranded on this planet for so long, the people of Crash have become heavily dependant on Entertainment Technology to pass their time and boost morale.  All forms of interactive gaming came be found here, from virtual reality to chess.  You quickly notice that for each patron of the facility there is at least one holographic attendant hovering nearby in anticipation of their needs.  Artificial intelligence allows even the best players of any game in the known universe a run for their money (literally) here.</desc>
