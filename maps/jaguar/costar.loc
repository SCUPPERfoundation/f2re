      <desc>Be careful looking too long at the exchange boards. They tend to mesmerize as is evidenced by the few drooling idiots sitting on the floor staring at the screens. The way to the LP is west.</desc>

      <desc>You come to a treetrunk blocking your way. Looking up you can barely make out a treehouse way up in the branches. There doesn&apos;t appear any way you could possibly get up there however. A chimpanzee looks at you from a branch above your head, grinning and gesturing. The way out is south.</desc>

      <desc>The path turns sharply to the north and west here. Clinging vines sway before your face, the sound of monkeys is occasionally drowned out by a loud yell. It almost sounds as though some man is calling for someone named Jane.</desc>
