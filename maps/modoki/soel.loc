      <name>Mokona&apos;s Room</name>
      <desc>   The office of Mokona Modoki, the founder of the Modoki system, is made for luxury. From here, Mokona can take a break from the hustle and bustle of running a planet and allow himself a good time for once. Dominating the center of the room is not a desk, but instead a gigantic, white pillow which looks to be about the same size as a king-sized bed. Mokona must have an excellent chef on his staff as many succulent foods are spread out on a long wooden table resting against the southern wall. The only other noteworthy piece of furniture is an entertainment certain with an excruciatingly large video console and several pictures of Mokona and his brother Mokona (who happens to be a white mokona).</desc>

      <name>Soel Landing Pad</name>
      <desc>   A red sky filled with fluffy white clouds looms overheard as you enter Soel&apos;s largest spaceport. Located on the outskirts of Soeru City, so as not to pollute the area, the spaceport is filled with White Mokonas and Black Mokonas as they assist traders with hauling goods to and from their cargo ships. A White Mokona walks up to you and offers to help you with any ship repairs that you may require.</desc>
      <desc>   Over to the side there is a directory with a small map of the city included. You can see a little Mokona shaped symbol next to an arrow that says, &quot;You are Here!&quot; pointing at a block in the northernmost point of the city.</desc>

      <name>Mr. Mokona&apos;s Stellar Sales</name>
      <desc>   Upon walking into this building you are struck by the sight of a rather realistic holographic projection of a Mammoth Class Cargo Hauler. Hovering three feet above a circular projector which juts slightly out of the floor, it would be difficult to tell the hologram from the real thing except for the fact that it is much smaller than the ship it is representing. Next to the projector unit, you see a black mokona talking to a human client who appears to be interested in the specific model floating before you. &quot;Mokona will be more than happy to help you pick out a ship if you&apos;re interested,&quot; a white mokona says to you as she approaches from your left.</desc>

      <name>Soeru City Industrial Zone</name>
      <desc>   The smell of the Soeru City Industrial Zone is the first thing that hits you when you walk through this area. Aromas of cinnamon, sugar, and every sweet substance you could ever imagine fill the air here. The mokonas here have obviously done something to create a pleasant atmosphere in what would normally be a heavily polluted area of the city. Factories of all kinds are located just off the main road which bisects the Industrial zone from north to south. One place of note is that the commodities exchange is located in a small building east of the main road. North of here is the main landing zone for interplanetary shuttle traffic. Another small building to the west has a picture of a white mokona making a spaceship out of lego blocks. The road also continues further south into the city.</desc>

      <name>Mokona &amp; Mokona Commodities Brokerage</name>
      <desc>   Walking into this room is quite different than one would imagine a normal commodities exchange. Cargo containers of all sizes and shapes fill this vast room to the brim, but there are still clearly defined walkways. Both white and black mokonas tap furiously on digital mokona assistants as trades are executed in one form or another. Curiously, an occasional mokona, after completing a sale, will open its mouth widely and inhale one of the cargo containers! Seeing your shock, a mokona comes up to you and explains that their people use inhalation techniques as you just witnessed to transport goods from the surface of the planet to orbiting cargo ships and vice versa.</desc>
      <desc>   A sign on the wall notes that any unauthorized factories will be inhaled by ravenous mokonas and launched into orbit, so it is highly recommended that permission for all buildings be granted first.</desc>

      <name>  M&amp;M Trader&apos;s Lounge and Break Room</name>
      <desc>   Just by looking at the place, one would hardly believe this is a trader&apos;s lounge. Over three times the size of the exchange room itself, the M&amp;M Trader&apos;s Lounge and Break Room is more like an oversized food court. The walls are lined with vendors from across the galaxy ready to peddle their highly addictive foods to the weary masses. Fedruckers, Nacho Bell, Burger Queen, and McMokona&apos;s are only a few of the assorted fast food establishments that are represented here. Mokonas of both types, white and black, fill the room as they talk about various trades, recently released movies, and what drink goes best with Zlitherworm casserole. Despite the fire marshall&apos;s advice, there is only one exit here to the west.</desc>

      <name>Soeru City General Hospital</name>
      <desc>   At first glance, Soeru City General Hospital appears to be a fully functional trauma center that also acts as the primary care facility for Soeru City. Of course... that fascade falls apart after you notice the unnecessary amount of video equipment around the hospital. Apparently, Soeru City General Hospital is actually the set of a nonstop 24 hour soap opera. Every once in a while you&apos;ll see a group of actors dressed as doctors, nurses, and patients going over their lines before shooting a scene in the main lobby. Unfortunately, it seems that the rest of the hospital is inaccessible to anyone other than the cast and crew. Before you decide to head out, you notice a confused insurance agent lurking about the lobby.</desc>

      <desc>   Soel&apos;s sun shines brightly through the red sky above as you walk through Soeru City&apos;s Service Quarter. Named mostly due to its content, the service quarter is home to all of the municipal services currently available in Soeru City. Here you can find the local police and fire departments as well as the municipal court where the local magistrate presides over criminal and civil cases originating within Soeru City. To the west, the Soeru City General Hospital towers over its neighboring buildings. Any medical needs you might have can be met there when necessary. The road also bends southwest from here.</desc>

      <name>Mokona World!</name>
      <desc>   Nestled quietly at the western edge of the Soeru City Recreation District is the future home of Mokona World! Already sporting a few completed amusement rides, it appears the construction of this facility is well under way. If you&apos;re not mistaken, the most prominent feature of Mokona World that you can see from the parking lot is a large space elevator. Based on what you know of physics, that space elevator shouldn&apos;t be able to exist, however the Mokonas apparently found a way to make it work. Hmm... Either way, the park isn&apos;t open yet, so the only way to go from here is east.</desc>

      <name>Soeru City Recreation District</name>
      <desc>   Heading into the recreation district, it&apos;s not hard to see where it got its name. This has to be the Mokonas&apos; version of Las Vegas from ancient Earth. The entire area is filled with casinos, cineplexes, 3 different sports stadiums, and that&apos;s just what you can tell from the first 30 seconds of walking around. A rather gaudy looking sign proclaiming that a new theme park, Mokona World, will open soon is set up to your west next to a large drive. As it is not closed off, it looks like you can head west into the park&apos;s parking lot. The Soeru City Service Quarter is northwest of your current location and you can see what appears to be a gated community to your southeast.</desc>

      <name>Security Check Point</name>
      <desc>   Upon approaching the security check point, you see two white mokonas checking the ID&apos;s of any traffic that wishes to pass by. One of the white mokonas walks up and informs you the area ahead is the Soeru City Residential Area and only residents are allowed to pass. The mokonas don&apos;t look like they&apos;d be able to stop you if you tried to run by the gate, however something inside you hinders you from wanting to attempt it. The white mokona heads back to the humble security shack that serves as the check point and smiles happily at the next resident to pass by. The only way to head from here is back northwest.</desc>
