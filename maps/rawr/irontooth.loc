      <desc>   You are now in a magnificent jet black lobby with a slightly domed glass ceiling which let&apos;s you stare at the starry filled space above. There are also glass windows on the sides which let you stare at the various stars and nebulae swirling about in space. The entire dock seems to have an upbeat energy to it as creatures of all sorts quickly move around you in all directions. Red, yellow, and orange lights are on the floors and line the walls giving off a fiery glow to the place. You spot a sign on the ceiling reading the following</desc>
      <desc>  Exchange     -     East</desc>
      <desc>  Lazy Stevedore&apos;s Bar &amp; Grill     -     SouthWest</desc>
      <desc>  Medical Services    -     South</desc>
      <desc>You see a crowd of Stevedore&apos;s in a two-way stream from the warehouse and loading sections chatting and laughing heartily as they flow through to the SouthWest. A hurried group of creatures in all manner of prestigious clothing run in and out of the East.</desc>

      <name>Irontooth Exchange</name>
      <desc>   The exchange spreads out before you - thousands of computer terminals in patterns that resemble crop circles sprawl out all over the place. Shouts of intense hard good and future trading fill the room as creatures of every kind imaginable stumble in and out of the chaos. The large room has warehouse-like lighting on a high ceiling that illuminates the room to such a degree that you don&apos;t think you see a shadow anywhere. A small exhibit on the wall is a showcase regarding the Irontooth Exchange. Apparently the exchange is basically a massive import/export hub in this part of space as the system does not have any habitable planets as of yet. You park yourself in front of the nearest available terminal and start trading.</desc>
      <desc>   As you start up the trading terminal the opening screen flashes a message with an image of a dragon in the background. &quot;Please make sure to occasionally visit the ANNOUNCEMENTS room to the EAST for special news/tips/hints regarding the economy!&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   LP is West.</desc>

      <name>Lazy Stevedore&apos;s Bar &amp; Grill</name>
      <desc>   As soon as you step inside the cozy large wooden bar you are assaulted by the scent of warm hearth fires and excellent homestyle food + drink wafting in from every direction. A seperate line for Stevedore&apos;s moves swiftly parallel to you as they scan in their cards and then take a seat at a table with their buddies. According to union rules apparently Stevedore&apos;s get to take a break after EVERY cargo loading/unloading job so you can be guaranteed this place will always be full. Huge elephant-like kettles of tea are being dragged on wooden carts all over the place for the Stevedore&apos;s who are in for union mandated tea breaks. A huge mess of droids with bowties slide all over the place as well to the tables with all sorts of delicacies such as Dragon&apos;s Fried Chicken, Fire Fries, Rawrburgers, Magmastone Pizzas, and all sorts of other comfort foods. Each meal is lovingly made by a top culinary expert utilizing only the finest ingredients. All of it is healthy for you too - yay!!!</desc>

      <name>Irontooth Medical Services</name>
      <desc>   Some of the galaxy&apos;s finest medical staff are on rounds here as they see patients from all over the stars. In contrast to the mostly jet black star station that is Irontooth this area of the dock is in a mostly white-alloy color reminiscent of old Earth Star Wars movies. You take a peek down at the emergency corridor and observe the various visitors being rolled in on stretchers.</desc>
      <desc>1) The skeletal remains of a hauler who forgot to eat between jobs</desc>
      <desc>2) An unconscious adventurer covered in a biological materials wrap who emits a radioactive glow</desc>
      <desc>3) Futures traders stuck in stasis due to malfunctioning chambers</desc>
      <desc>4) A bloated stevedore attached to a pump which is trying to pull out massive amounts of tea from the lungs</desc>
      <desc>5) A rough looking fellow in a worn leather jacket with blaster and phaser burn scars all over their body</desc>
      <desc>6) A group of handcuffed rioters with minor bumps and bruises. Their sleeves have the insignia of &apos;The Weatherman Cult&apos; emblazoned on it</desc>
      <desc>   LP is north from here</desc>
