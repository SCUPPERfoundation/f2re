      <name>Thorus Station Docking Bay</name>
      <desc>   The cavernous docking bay has flexible doors that form a tight seal with the airlock of your shuttle, allowing you free access back and forth from the station&apos;s control room to the south.  Your ship&apos;s cargo holds remain open to vacuum to allow free access by automated steve-a-droids, should you need them.</desc>

      <name>Thorus Station Exchange</name>
      <desc>Trading with the station is all done remotely. As you sell goods, they are moved by steve-a-droids from the hold of your ship into smaller holding piles around the station; as you buy, the droids reclaim from selected larger heaps and fill your cargo hold with the purchased commodities.

      <name>Control room</name>
      <desc>   This is the hub of the massive toroidal station, most of which isn&apos;t accessible to visitors or merchants. There&apos;s a mechanical hum and lots of twinkling lights, the function of which is generally incomprehensible, as the automated station goes about the business of keeping its systems operational.</desc>
      <desc>   Vending machines sell refreshments to keep trade weary merchants alive and in good health.</desc>
      <desc>   A bulge in the station bulkhead to the west has a remote trading machine; while to the east is an autodoc medical unit.</desc>
      <desc>   Two portholes southeast and southwest will let you look out of the station.</desc>

      <desc>   The large red cross on this machinery is the universally understood sign showing that it will cure any illness, heal any wounds or broken bones, or failing that will activate your clone and send you off good as new. You will even have pleasant dreams while the autodoc works on you, thanks to the very latest in mood-enhancing anesthetic drugs.</desc>

      <desc>   You gaze out of the porthole at the immensity of space; the countless stars twinkling in a hypnotic manner remind you of the lights in the control room. You find it hard to tear your eyes away from the grandeur of it all. Off to the side you see the interstellar link rotating serenely in space. The station is in a locked orbit to keep it in position with the link.</desc>
      <desc>   You can see part of the station&apos;s hull from here. A droid is welding something, patching up a worn spot, or perhaps where an errant cargo bin collided with the hull.</desc>
      <desc>   There&apos;s an access hatch above you leading to a duct. The control room is northeast.</desc>

      <desc>   You have a magnificent view of the enormous piles of commodities, heaped in space around the station.   As you watch, remote steve-a-droids scurry between piles, sorting and consolidating like commodities.  You notice that with a disturbing frequency, a portion of a pile is diverted into a secret compartment in the droid&apos;s service ship, as the droid heads off to an unknown destination.</desc>

      <name>Duct</name>
      <desc>   All space stations or ships have ducts which you can just about crawl through if you really have an urge to, and this is no exception! Wiring runs along the walls, great big bunches of brightly colored wires, probably carrying a very high voltage.</desc>
      <desc>   The walls are covered with a dirty, greasy film. Not very pleasant!</desc>
      <desc>   The duct leads east into an open space of some kind. An access hatch leads down.</desc>

      <desc>   This is where the habitat&apos;s droids come when they are not working. They line the walls all around you - some almost human-shaped, some just boxes on wheels. The droids here are all powered down and inoperative - asleep, if you like! - But as soon as they are needed the controlling computer will activate them and off they will go to carry out their assigned task.</desc>

      <desc>   This duct is lined with piping - pipes of all sizes, some so hot to the touch that you burn yourself, others so cold that you almost leave some skin on the pipe. The floor is made up of loose metal grates that clank and rattle every time you move. It would not be a good place to hide!</desc>
