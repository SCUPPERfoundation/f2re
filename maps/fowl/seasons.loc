This planet is very strange as to the fact it does not turn and the seasons stay where they are all year round, so if you are warm go to Winter portal and take the shuttle to cool down. If you want to get warm, go to the Summer portal. Love leaves and wind? Go to the Autumn portal. Flowers and green earth? Spring portal is what you want. This planet is very diverse and we hope you enjoy.</desc>
