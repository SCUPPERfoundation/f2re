      <name>Munitions Depot</name>
      <desc>After a few minutes arguing with the MP&apos;s at the entrance you finally manage to convince them that you don&apos;t pose a threat to National Security and they decide to let you pass</desc>
      <desc>As you enter depot you are astonished to see huge stockpiles of missiles and ammo surrounding you. While taking a look around you notice a short, fat man in a uniform examining a clipboard while sitting at a desk in an otherwise empty corner of the depot. You can only assume that this must be the supply sergeant and that if you need anything you must go through this sad excuse for a soldier.</desc>

      <name>Aid Station</name>
      <desc>After entering the first thing you notice is all the vacant cots in neat rows along both sides of the tent. Upon further inspection you see that there are indeed a few occupied cots with nurses and doctors roving back and forth between them.</desc>
      <desc>Just then a young woman in fatigues appears out of nowhere and asks, &quot;Are you injured or just visiting?&quot;</desc>

      <name>Pentagon Hangar (Shipyard)</name>
      <desc>As you enter the Hangar you see various different models of ships strewn about everywhere. You are astonished (having traveled all over the galaxy) to make out numerous ships that you have never even heard about, let alone seen. A man in coveralls seems to be working on one of these crafts, and since he is the only one around you assume that he must be in charge. The only problem is he is several times larger than you and it looks as if he is very busy.</desc>

      <name>Officer&apos;s Club</name>
      <desc>As you open the door the room exhales a massive waft of pale blue haze. You press on through the cigar smoke and discover that the bar crammed wall to wall with service men and women. You are beginning to wonder if you belong here, when an attractive waitress saunters over carrying a hefty tray full of shots whispers, &quot;Pick your poison soldier.&quot;</desc>

      <name>Pentagon Landing Pad</name>
      <desc>As you step onto the landing pad there is a flurry of commotion all around you! Men and women in uniforms race back and forth into and out of the entrance to a huge building SOUTH of your present location. To the EAST you notice a constant stream of people (presumably merchants and traders) dashing in and out of the exchange. To the WEST you observe a group of service men stumbling clumsily out of the Officer&apos;s Club. NORTH of you an Aid Station has been set up for either those unfortunate souls that have fallen ill or those foolish enough not to follow the Air Force&apos;s orders. In the NORTHEAST corner of the LP you notice a small Hangar with a trickle of patrons striding to and fro. Off to the NORTHWEST you watch as two soldiers pace back and forth on either side of the entrance to a Munitions Depot.</desc>

      <name>Pentagon Exchange</name>
      <desc>The exchange looks oddly out of place here. It is bizarre to see an area totally devoid of military personnel on a planet made for them. Apparently, soldiers are not allowed to trade on this planet (too many issues with black market military supplies in the past). Looking around you see large hi-tech screens displaying the latest prices and availability for a range of commodities from Alloys to Xmetals. There are traders and merchants all over the place, yelling at the top of their lungs, trying to buy or sell commodities before the prices change. You are left standing there contemplating whether or not you might be better off going back to hauling things around for Armstrong Cuthbert.</desc>

      <name>Pentagon Foyer</name>
      <desc>Your eyes are filled with magnificently drab surroundings. It is very easy to tell that this is a government installation. The mostly blank walls stare at you with an unrelenting gaze. In the heart of this dreary den there is a receptionist&apos;s desk staffed by a cute but harsh female. When the receptionist sees you standing there, looking around, she stares directly at you and asks you in a cold monotone voice, &quot;Can I help you with something?&quot;</desc>
      <desc>Not wanting to be arrested on the spot you explain to her that you have business here and show her the documents to prove it. She looks over the credentials very carefully and decides to let you enter. You let a sigh of relief and continue on your way.</desc>

      <name>Hot Tub</name>
      <desc>As you step in the water your skin screeches with a brief moment pain which dies away rather quickly when you settle all the way down into the 104 degree water. The refreshing hot water swirls around as your mind drifts off thinking of nothing but, well, nothing. When you finally, begrudgingly, decide it is time to get out you are surprised to find that 2 hours have passed. You begin to wonder if Ike had ever shown up and if he had, and you weren&apos;t in his office how mad he might be.</desc>

      <name>Ike&apos;s Lounge</name>
      <desc>Ike&apos;s lounge comes complete with a full bar, a beautiful maple table which can serve as either a dinner or conference table, and a leather couch that folds out to a bed. The cushions on the couch look as if they have been thrown back on rather hastily, leading you to believe that Ike must really spend alot of time here. For some reason you feel like you are intruding in a private area and decide it would be best to leave before the General gets back but not before you notice a hot tub hiding in the corner of the room. Do you dare?</desc>

      <name>General Eisenhower&apos;s Office</name>
      <desc>Ike&apos;s personal lair is filled with memorabilia from his early days coming up through the ranks of both Classic and Fed2. Some of his more fond memories are in the form of pictures hanging on his wall. Directly behind his desk you see a picture of him shaking hands with some one. Underneath the picture a caption reads &quot;The day I became a Duke!&quot; Off to the right of that picture you see another, this time of his wife from classic, Mystikalblondie. Still another picture shows Ike holding up a copy of the Federation 2 Hall of Fame Book. A caption underneath reads &quot;Genike sets a new record for fastest promotion from trader to industrialist! Only takes a day and a half!&quot; (a P.S. has been added stating that the record has now been broken by Yuko). Gazing around further it appears that this chamber serves as more of a second home than just an office. There are doors in the East and West walls both appear to be private but curiosity gets the better of you and you decide to check them out.</desc>

This personal secretary looks to be in her 50&apos;s and has an aurora of niceness surrounding her. Upon seeing you enter the room she immediately flashes you a smile and politely inquires as to why you are visiting today.</desc>
      <desc>After hearing your reasons for wanting to see the General she asks you, respectfully, to take a seat. Next she discreetly mumbles something into a comm unit on her desk, waits a minute for a response, then turns to you and courteously says, &quot;The General will be with you in a moment, feel free to wait in his office.&quot; She smiles sweetly and points to a mahogany door in the North wall of the room.</desc>
