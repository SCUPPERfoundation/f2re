From here, the company oversees and monitors all aspects of Arovian production, from the factories in Celas Ter to the fleet on Navarium. Grey haired executives in three piece suits order subtle tweaks to market factors to maximize profitability. The latest exchange and futures prices flow over large displays scattered about the room. Junior executives bustle about, some collecting data and others going to visit production facilities onsite. Waitdroids glide silently about the room, providing any necessary refreshment.</desc>

A diligent searcher could find such texts as &quot;Back to the Mines, I Don&apos;t Care How Deep the Water Is: My Life as a Workthing&quot; by Anonymous, to &quot;How to Destroy Enemies and Terrify People&quot; by Ming the Merciless. The Duke&apos;s own bestselling comedy, &quot;The Baron who Knew too Little&quot;, is also among these works. The book cases reach all the way to the ceiling, forming an almost maze-like array of passages through the books. A portrait of a remote, jungle world hangs on the east wall.

The quastores, elected from the commercial, industrial, and spacing groups of Arovia, pass judgment on these matters. As many as six trials can be conducted simultaneously in this Court, and the court room is filled with elated and disappointed litigants, and bored or irritated witnesses.

      <name>Flight from Estate</name>
      <desc>Arovia was a small, uninhabited world before the Constant Catastrophe. Its story begins with Jazir, who at the time of the Constant Catastrophe was the reigning Duke of Estate.</desc>
      <desc>   Estate was a small world located near the edges of the known galaxy. When the Links were knocked out by the Catastrophe, the gravitronic engines stabilizing Estate&apos;s orbit became inoperable. The planet&apos;s orbit began a slow decay, eventually spiraling into its sun. Foreseeing this, Jazir ordered the construction of an enormous spacecraft, powered by sublight speed engines, to evacuate the planet&apos;s population to Earth. The craft was completed in time, and the Estatans were evacuated safely. The long voyage took nearly a century, however. Once on Earth, the Estatans settled themselves among new bases in the asteroid field, while Jazir sought new planets to explore and rule.</desc>

The company, leveraging Jazir&apos;s personal expertise with the manufacture of weapons, armor, and their components, quickly became one of the leading industrial enterprises of its day. The company fed the various factions of the Galactic Administration with enough weaponry to keep them all nervous, and thus in need of more weaponry. The enormous profits realized from this venture allowed Jazir to finance the exploration of undeveloped star systems, leading to the discovery of Arovia.</desc>

Several droid-piloted State class frigates, containing all the materials required for the Interstellar Link, were launched at near light speeds to the Arov star system. Once they arrived, several months of intricate, remotely-guided droid work was necessary to assemble the link. Finally, Jazir was able to jump to the system, and establish the first advance base on the surface. Arovia proved uninhabited, but construction soon began on Celas Ter, the capital city of the new planet.</desc>
      <desc>  Arovia is now operated by the Interstellar Sword &amp; Dagger Company under exclusive franchise from the Galactic Administration, for the greater glory and profit of the Imperium.</desc>

      <desc>The trail winds southeast into the Harig mountains from Celas Ter in the northwest. A cool, crisp breeze gently sweeps the trail. The view from the mountain trail provides a breathtaking panorama of the city. The sun plays off the emerald and turquoise toned metal used to construct most of the buildings in Celas Ter, giving the city a luminous glow. Up higher in the mountains, around a small bend in the path, a strange purple glow is visible.</desc>

      <name>Factory</name>
      <desc>A vacuum sealed cavern houses a precision tools factory, which creates electronics and engines designed to the highest degrees of perfection for use on starships, transports, and computers. The workers are draped in spacesuits, and craft these delicate components to the picometer to ensure their proper performance. A force field provides additional protection from outside contamination, and also prevents the visitor from interfering with production. The exit is northwest.</desc>

      <name>Power Collector</name>
      <desc>The power collector is a large, stepped pyramid located atop the Harig mountains with a great, focused purple light streaming down from the sky into its summit. Power is collected from the Arovian sun by a network of satellites, and transmitted to a central satellite in geosynchronous orbit above this location. The energy is then beamed to the collector in a high frequency tachyon ray. Force fields focus and contain the energy, ensuring no loss of power during transmission. Conduits glowing with energy emerge symmetrically from the collector, before plunging into the earth to carry the power to Celas Ter. The only path from this area leads down the mountain to the southwest.</desc>

      <name>Arovian Shipyard</name>
      <desc>Arovia&apos;s shipyard is a model of organized chaos. The entire west wall of the cavern has been removed, opening the way for completed ships to reach the stars. Starships in various stages of construction are scattered about this vast cavern, while droids and workers race about with parts and tools. Surface vehicles are also manufactured here, with an assembly line devoted to aeroskimmers, Slitfire bombers, and hovercraft.</desc>
      <desc>   A full panoply of spaceship services are offered for visitors here, including repairs, and even custom built ships. A terminal droid sits complacently awaiting such instructions. The exit is north.</desc>

      <name>Observatory</name>
      <desc>High atop the Harig mountains lies the Arovian observatory. The observatory fulfills many roles. It is a research station, monitoring and studying the celestial conditions of the Arov system. It also tracks every starship in the system, and maintains the nav beacon network to ensure safe transit through Arovian space. Its security purposes are classified, but it is rumored that the observatory maintains a network of defensive satellites to repulse any orbital threat before it reaches the planet.</desc>
      <desc>   Access into the observatory is restricted to authorized ISD personnel only. A pathway leads down the mountain to the north.</desc>
