      <desc>   Thankfully, this taxi-whale is a much more pleasant ride than the one you took into Reef City, however a previous occupant has left a message scratched into a row of baleen: &quot;Jonah wuz here.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   Your ride passes quickly and eventually you feel the taxi-whale slow and then stop. The whale politely opens his mouth, allowing you to disembark.</desc>

      <desc>   You enter the small structure, and then descend into the underwater observatory that contains the planetary exchange. Unfortunately, as the landing platform is floating over the open ocean, nothing can be seen through the viewing ports but the empty deep blue sea.</desc>
      <desc>   A water gate, where Oceania&apos;s merfolk merchants regularly arrive to offer the bounty of the seas, occupies the center of the room. Eager traders and merchants from across the galaxy vie for the enormous pearls, sponges, and lampshades made from seashells as the merfolk ply their wares. The din is deafening.</desc>

      <desc>   The shuttle landing pad floats atop an endless sea of blue. In every direction, from horizon to horizon: water. To the north, a small enclosed structure leads to the Oceania exchange.</desc>
      <desc>   Cowering in terror in the exact center of the platform is a man in green coveralls with a patch emblazened with the letters &quot;AC.&quot; He mutters something about being assigned to this backwater planet and not being able to swim. &quot;I&apos;d even take an assignment to Brass,&quot; he complains as he nervously eyes the water. Nearby, an out-of-work repair droid tries to make a groat or two washing shuttles, and a used-ship salesman has a small stand off to one side.</desc>
      <desc>   A small box labelled &quot;Artificial gills&quot; rests on the edge of the platform. Above the box, a sign reads &quot;Welcome to Oceania. If you do not have gills or other organs for breathing underwater, please help yourself.&quot; On all sides (other than the structure to the north), the pristine blue waters await.</desc>

The whale appears beat up and unsteady, and seems to be swerving around drunkenly. A small sign on the whale&apos;s back reads &quot;TAXI&quot; in glowing letters. The whale notices you and approaches. Its mouth opens expectantly, clearly waiting for you to swim into its mouth for a ride, but its inebriated state is a cause for concern. Perhaps you should find a different taxi.</desc>

      <desc>   The doorway from the center of the leisure tower to the west opens up into an enormous room which houses King Neptune&apos;s gardens. Carefully grown coral topiary and fields of underwater lilies and other flowering sea flora shimmer in the light of the sunfish swimming far overhead, near the ceiling of the cavernous structure. Impeccably manicured aquascapes are layed out in precise arrangements with pathways between, where visitors swim leisurely, enjoying the peaceful surroundings.</desc>

      <name>Bubble Room</name>
      <desc>   The bubble room in the Coral Palace&apos;s leisure tower is where aliens, merfolk and other sea creatures come to relax after a long day. The warm water and refreshing bubbles soothe the body and mind. A solitary blue starfish attached in the center of the ceiling provides just enough light to cause the bubbles to shimmer as they rise from the tiny holes in the floor, and the only sounds are the quiet murmurings of brief conversation as the beings around you relax and unwind.</desc>
      <desc>  Stay as long as you wish, and when you are ready, exit to the north, relaxed, refreshed, and ready to face more hauling, or trading, sleeping in your exchange, or whatever it is you do to make a groat.</desc>
