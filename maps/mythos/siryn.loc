      <desc>   Deep inside the bowels of the tree itself is a hidden room.  There is solar lighting here, almost natural in appearance, and a laptop that currently displays the shopping page for a shoe catalog.  A dark green loveseat rests against one wall, several books stacked on the end table next to it.  A vid screen is recessed into the opposite wall, slightly dusty from disuse.</desc>
      <desc>   Hidden behind a screen is a large bed, books resting on the nightstand and a locked journal atop those.  The elusive scent of jasmine seems to lurk in the blue-green coverlet and soft linen sheets, as well as in the braided rug on the floor.  A large closet, filled to capacity, is next to the bed, while an elegant dresser is also neatly but efficiently filled.</desc>
      <desc>   The bath is a large, wood-carved tub, large enough for two to share comfortably, surrounded by thick, soft towels and a wide array of toiletries.  Other facilites are neatly hidden behind another screen.</desc>

You claw your way to gasp a precious breath of air, only to catch a stinging mouthful of salt water in the face.  The water fills your lungs as you go under again.  Your clothing is a leaden weight and your muscles start to cramp as you force your head to break the surface again.</desc>

      <desc>   Faux-insects dart around you.  None of them sting, but a few of them have rather nasty bites, leaving you with red welts.  The air is nearly still here, hanging in heavy dampness that soaks any clothing you may be wearing.  As you follow the river you occasionally hear a rustle over the drone of insects, but never see anything.</desc>
      <desc>   Finally you can see a break in the jungle as the river pours out to the ocean.  Better yet, you see a bamboo hut, just to the southwest.</desc>

Although there are several oars in the boat, you are hard-pressed to bail the water from the boat enough to stay afloat.  The water is dark and spray-flecked,  making it hard to tell the difference between sky and water, but a darker mass appears to the northwest.</desc>
      <desc>   Abandoning all attempts to bail, you work the oars, salt spray and rain lashing your face.  Your shoulders feel the burn first, then your triceps.  Blisters form on your hands and are rubbed raw, so that the oars are slick with water and blood.  Your lungs feel on fire, each gasp of breath a knife in your chest, but still you row.</desc>
      <desc>   You are so fixated on the land that you don&apos;t notice a huge wave that lifts your boat, holds it in the air for one frozen, lazy moment, and then dashes it down to the water with all the force of a giant fist.

      <desc>   Days drag by, the passage of time only marked by the small pan of water that is shoved into the hold twice each day.  Eventually the water comes less frequently, then not at all.  Several of the injured crew succumb to their injuries, adding to the rank smell.  The last of you decide to go above decks.  Better to die quickly than remain here and die little by little.</desc>

      <name>A Rock and a Hard Place: &quot;Lied van het Overzees&quot;</name>
      <desc>   Large rocks jut out up in front of the ship without warning.  You must veer northeast or southeast to avoid being dashed upon them.</desc>
      <desc>   To the northeast, a swirling whirlpool threatens to sink the ship and everyone aboard-- including you.  To the southeast, a grotesque female seamonster lurks.  Six long-necked heads snake about, each gnashing three rows of razor-sharp teeth.  Deep, beautiful eyes leer at the ship, while a long fish-like tail slaps the red-tinged water behind her.</desc>
      <desc>   You will have to choose which way to proceed: northeast toward the whirlpool or southeast toward the monster.</desc>

      <name>1967 Corvette Stingray</name>
      <desc>   This long, low-slung car has plenty of room for a driver and passenger to sit comfortably inside, or you can camp out on the Triple Tuxedo black hood with the blankets in the backseat.  With plenty of chrome on the wheels and bumpers and a thick coat of wax on the chassis, it&apos;s easy to stare at the car and not the movie-- or your date.</desc>
      <desc>   The sound comes from the speakers inside the car and, while it was state-of-the-art in 1967 Earth, it doesn&apos;t have quite the realism of modern equipment.</desc>

      <name>Drive-in Theatre</name>
      <desc>   The drive-in here consists of a large, old fashioned video screen and stereo units, all enclosed in a force field to keep the sound and light from leaking out.</desc>
      <desc>   Because there is no automated transport on Siryn, the empty chassis of classic cars are arrayed in front of the screen.  Radio units inside the cars transmit all the sound, leaving the outside of the theatre oddly quiet.</desc>
      <desc>   There is a concessions stand selling snack foods and beverages.  The distinct odor of buttery popcorn permeates the area and small local seabirds hop through the theatre, pecking up dropped pieces.</desc>
      <desc>   Currently your car choices are a candy apple red 1966 Mustang to the northwest or a shiny black-and-chrome 1967 Corvette Stingray to the west.  The path leading away from the theatre is to the northeast.</desc>
      <desc>   The current movie is a tedious piece about a world that has lost all its land and is now covered by one endless ocean.</desc>

      <desc>   Scent overwhelm all other senses when you first step into this room.  Garlic, herbs, freshly-baked bread, and simmering sauces waft about you, drawing you further into the room.  As your eyes adjust to the low candlelight, you can see five round tables, prepared for just two diners apiece, circled around a larger center table that could easily hold eight.  Each table is set with a large candle as a centerpiece, containers of olive oil and vinegar, and a covered bowl of shredded cheese.  At each place is a ceramic plate and bowl, silverware, and a wine goblet.</desc>
      <desc>   A Siryne waiter sets printed menus in front of each diner, bringing glasses of water and a basket of warm garlic rolls.  The cuisine is similar to Earth mediterranean, although there are dishes and ingredients you have never seen before.  The list of wines, many of them local, is also extensive, filling a page.</desc>

Small tables and chairs are scattered about the room, most of them occupied, but a few still empty.

      <desc>   There is a datapad at each table listing songs by singer, genre, planet, and almost any other variable you can think of trying.  Selections can be made from the datapad; after that, the lucky singer waits his turn to go onstage, stand before the floodlights, and belt out something that may or may not resemble the original recording.</desc>

For a brief moment, a long-neck extends and you see a beautiful, yet frightening, face in front of you and smell the fetid stink of death deep in your lungs before the neck whips to one side and those terrifying fangs sink into one of the crewmembers, dragging him screaming out of the ship.</desc>
      <desc>   Each of the other five heads grab a crewmember and drag him under the water, the deep blue turned into a violent red, bits of gore floating on the water.  The ship sails on, a few crewmembers keeping their heads long enough to sail out of the deadly reach of the Scylla.</desc>

      <desc>   You sail on to the creak of timbers and the soft crash of waves.  Then, without warning, the sailors scramble on the deck, loading harpoon guns with efficiency.  Almost faster than your eye can follow, they fire simultaneously.  Three harpoons hit the water; there is a jolt and a huge splash, then the ship is being tugged sideways, as a great white whale strains against the harpoon sunk deep into its side.</desc>
      <desc>   The water froths with foam and blood as the whale thrashes about, skittering the ship across the surface of the waves with each jerk.  Masts and lines lean to one side, at their limits, so that the harpoon line feeds out with a rapid buzz.  The mate turns the ship painstakingly, attempting to point the bow in the same direction the whale is now rampaging.  When the harpoon line reaches its limit with an audible snap, the ship leaps forward, dragged by the massive whale.</desc>
      <desc>   Your only option is to follow the whale north-- anything else will destroy the ship.</desc>

      <desc>   The small space stinks of fish, salt, and your own stale sweat as you try to wait the pirates out.  Days spent with no food leave you weak, but when the water runs out, you finally creep back onto the deck.</desc>
