      <name>Shuttle pad</name>
      <desc>  You are on the shuttle pad for Toontown.  It&apos;s a broad platform high above the ground on top of one of those impossibly tall buildings so common in cartoons.  Along one edge of the platform is a sign proclaiming &quot;Jarrow&apos;s Ship Yard, Toontown Branch&quot;.  A friendly looking old cartoon man with a white moustache and white jumpsuit with a &quot;Spaceley&apos;s Sprockets&quot; patch on it stands over there, ready to sell you a new ship or service the one you&apos;ve got.  A sexy-looking cartoon woman wears the characteristic green coverall of an Armstrong Cuthbert agent on the opposite edge in a glass booth which muffles the noise of the shuttle pad.  Invisible force fields around the edges of the platform keep anyone without the ability to fly from falling over the edges.  A loud &quot;ding!&quot; announces the arrival of an elevator.  The door opens, and a small, droopy-eared, white dog wearing a red bellhop&apos;s uniform with gold trim announces, &quot;Going down, sir,&quot; without apparent joy in his voice.</desc>

      <name>Scream Therapy</name>
      <desc>  Your eardrums are assaulted by loud screams as you enter, the sound of patients releasing their frustrations through screaming and letting it all out.  All the seating in here is occupied by toons, most of whom seem to be on the verge of nervous breakdowns, many of them with visible nervous twitches or tics.  Not that that&apos;s unusual around here.  From this side, you can see the big, heavy door leading out to the south is also heavily padded to keep noise from escaping the room.  With all the loud screaming you&apos;re hearing in here, perhaps a hasty retreat is in order before you start going deaf.</desc>

Law Offices of Howard, Fine, and Howard, specializing in personal injury cases.&quot;  A secretary sits at a desk and asks if she can help you.  Suddenly the glass door on the west side flies open and out runs a fat character with hair like sandpaper, chased by an angry looking character with a hairstyle that looks like a bowl was put over his head, and everything that showed got trimmed.  &quot;You imbecile, I&apos;ll murder you!&quot; he shouts, chasing the fat man around the secretary&apos;s desk.  Finally he catches up and clunks him on the head with a wrench.  The fat man whimpers a bit, then points to the wrench and says, &quot;Oh look!&quot;  The wrench is seriously deformed from the blow!

A couple exceptions are a couple of love seats facing a fireplace with a roaring fire going, which supplements the low lights.  There are even a few stockings hung over the fireplace, along with bells and candles on the mantle, and a mirror with artificial frost around the edges above that.  What&apos;s more, the decor is up at this time of year.  Romantic and cozy, I&apos;m sure, when the weather&apos;s cold.

The dual faces of comedy and tragedy are portrayed on the round face of a black and white cat above the tunnel, one looking like he&apos;s laughing hard, the other looking sad and worried.  Toon cars, trucks, taxis, and other vehicles zip into and out of it, some beeping the notes to &quot;Shave and a haircut&quot; while inside the tunnel, others beeping back with the &quot;two bits&quot; notes.  In fact, you&apos;re hearing that melody very frequently here.  Every so often an ambulance comes racing out of the lot or careens into the lot on the south side of the road, which also holds a large institutional building.

You can hear the refrains of &quot;Shave and a haircut, two bits&quot; echoing out from inside the tunnel in various keys as toon automobiles toot their horns to that rhythm.

      <desc>  Noises catch your attention, and looking down the corridor you see two patients in hospital gowns come speeding down the straightaway on gurneys.  Whooping things up, they turn the corner, right towards a doctor.  With quick reflexes the doctor grabs them each by one ear, pulls them off the gurneys, and says, &quot;All right, back to your rooms, you two,&quot; leading them away by the ears.</desc>

      <desc>  The corridor goes east-west here, with a pair of glass double doors on the south side leading outside.  You can see benches, trees, and other vegetation out there.  Perhaps it&apos;s a place where the patients can relax freely.</desc>

      <name>Ink &amp; Paint Club</name>
      <desc> As you enter, the first thing that strikes you is that this place is immense!  Cavernous wooden walls house the whole club.  A cartoon octopus tends a long oak bar along the wall next to the door, dispensing drinks and taking payments. Small cartoon penguin waiters dressed in their natural tuxedos roam the floor, bringing diners their food and drinks to order.  One of them has what looks like Scotch on the rocks -- real rocks.</desc>
      <desc> Up on a stage occupying the south side of the room are two ducks, one black, one white, playing duelling pianos, and entertaining the audience with the familiar Hungarian rhapsody. </desc>
      <desc> A voice in the crowd catches your attention, but because of its shrillness, not because she&apos;s talking to you -- &quot;Work&apos;s been kind of slow since cartoons went to color, but I&apos;ve still got it, Eddie.  Boop Boop be doop, Boop!&quot;</desc>
      <desc> &quot;Yeah, you&apos;ve still got it,&quot; a man in a hat at a nearby table replies.</desc>
      <desc> The exit, when you&apos;re ready to leave, is north.</desc>

      <name>Barnyard</name>
      <desc>  The road comes to an end at a farm.  Cartoon chickens, ducks, and other birds scratch and peck away at the ground in this open area.  A short pig wearing blue overalls and a straw hat greets you and welcomes you to his farm with a stutter that&apos;s impossible to miss, and tosses some seed to the birds, which continue pecking away. A farmhouse sits on the west side of the yard.  A large toon dog sleeps on the porch in front of the door, while cats sleep on a porch swing as well as on the roof of the porch.  The door to a large barn stands open to the south, while wooden rails fence off pastures on the east side, where some large bulls graze.  A road leads away to the north.</desc>

      <desc>   You are in a supply closet.  Boxes of rubber gloves, disposable thermometer covers, hospital gowns, blue paper surgery masks, syringes, spools of stitching thread, laxatives, and tongue depressors, among other things, fill the shelves.  Nothing really interesting or useful there.  The way out is north.</desc>

      <desc>  Stepping out the doors, you are greeted with the sounds of a jungle.  The sun up in the sky seems to see you and with a mischievous smile shines a bit more warmly on you, even though it&apos;s already feeling hotter than comfortable.  Several pairs of eyes open up, looking at you from deep shade.  Making your way to the south side, the vegetation thins out and you can see vast fields and pastures on the other side of a chain link fence.  Looking up, you see the fence actually encloses the whole area around you, and the only way you can go is back inside to the north.</desc>

      <name>Recovery room</name>
      <desc> You are in a care ward, part of which looks as if it has been recently used.  A pink-furred feline nurse in a white uniform with a badge reading &quot;La Rue&quot; is doing a little bit of housekeeping here, making the bed and disposing of used supplies.  She also carries a clipboard with the paperwork to renew life insurance if needed.  Windows on both the north and east sides give a view across open areas and into town.</desc>
      <desc> The decor inside the room is rather unusual for a hospital.  Aside from the usual bed, a six-foot tall Douglas fir tree decorated with ornaments sits in a corner of the room with colorfully wrapped packages lying underneath it!  Also, you notice a sprig of mistletoe is taped to the headboard of the far bed.  Hmm, wonder who that lucky patient might have been.  The exit is northwest.</desc>

      <name>Barn</name>
      <desc>  A wide aisle separates the barn into sections.  Chickens cluck away contentedly in nests on the east side.  A conveyor belt runs underneath them, collecting all the eggs they lay, which come rolling down chutes under each nest, and dumps the eggs into cartons at the end of the belt.  Stalls on the west side house cows, which milk themselves here, along with a few horses, idly munching on hay.  The farmer seems to have things quite easy here with all the automation.  The barn door lies open to the north.</desc>
