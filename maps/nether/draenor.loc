      <desc>This is a non-descript piece of flotsam from the world known as Outland.  The ogre&apos;s have set up a colony here primarily for the purpose of making biological products.  It has long been thought that ogre&apos;s were rather dull-witted.  However, their science has progressed far beyond what anyone has imagined.  They don&apos;t want anyone to know either.  As a result, much of the this land mass is off limits to vistors.</desc>
