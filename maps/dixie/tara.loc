In this main area of the garden, you see a stone wishing well located just to the left of the stone path. On either side of the well are several rose bushes, deep crimson red on the right, and stark white on the left. Lush bluegrass covers the entire area. Placed in front of the bushes are benches on which to sit and admire the beauty that surrounds you. While sitting there taking in the scenery, you notice a few of the roses have been cut, and you wonder who would deface such a wonderful place. As you get up to take a closer look you get the urge to toss a coin in the wishing well and make a wish for good luck.

On either side of the isle are wooden pews that have been painstakingly carved from ancient oak trees. At the end of the isle is a mahogany lectern atop the dais. Organ pipes stand along the back wall reaching to nearly the height of the room, you can imagine that the sound created here would be tremendous.</desc>

Although Tara Prison isn&apos;t surrounded by water on four sides, it has often been compared to Alcatraz in its ability to thwart hopes of escape. Gloom is added to by the lack of color as everything is painted a manky shade of institutional gray.</desc>

      <name>Shady Acres Courtyard Market</name>
      <desc>   A large cobblestone courtyard serves as an open air market for Tara. The courtyard is nestled in the shade of a 200-year-old oak tree. Legend has it that it has stood for an untold number of centuries. Its massive roots exposed in places among the cobblestones. The numerous branches and leaves provide shade for the wagon vendors and buyers that frequent the market.</desc>
      <desc>   People come and go, carrying baskets for market, from the lowest beggar to the highest noble, all come here to check out the wares of the merchants. The noise is impressive, with the call of men to their animals, and loud negotiations and haggling over prices.</desc>

      <desc>   You are standing in the midst of a most extraordinary room. The walls and ceiling are covered in faux-fur, in varying shades and patterns... zebra, lion, and leopard. Chairs circle wooden tables marred by years of use. A disco ball spins its multitude of flashing reflections around the room. Colored spotlights focus on an elevated stage, complete with a runway, recessed lighting, fireman&apos;s pole, and draped with a fake bear skin. Definitely the epitome of tasteless, to the extreme.</desc>
      <desc>   A black lacquer bar extends the full length of one wall, bordered with high-back bar stools covered in faux-fur. A black lacquer credenza behind the bar displays various alcoholic spirits, and the full glass racks overhead vibrate from the loud music as the DJ turns the bass up on the 4&apos; speakers, causing your very soul to undulate from the reverberation. As you scope the place, you realize that distorted viewing from limited lighting is sometimes a blessing in disguise.</desc>

      <desc>   Your attention is drawn to the (W) where you hear music and wolf calls that remind you of hard-legs gawking from a construction site. A neon in-motion sign flashes the familiar dancer lifting her skirt like a Marilyn Monroe wanna-be. A building stands to the (N) and its barred windows give it a formidable appearance. The street leads (S) where you see trench-coated characters approach people in whispery voices. There&apos;s no other way out except to pass by them. Maybe you can pick up your pace and focus straight ahead like a man on a mission and they won&apos;t bother with you. Good luck...</desc>

The news stand is nothing more than a mere wooden cart on wheels rigged with racks to display sleazy magazines like &quot;Amateur Porn&quot; and &quot;Beaver Hunt.&quot; Chances are that Louie doesn&apos;t even have a permit to pedal his goods, but the wheeled cart makes for a quick get-away if he senses trouble. You spot the latest issue of &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; and the headline on the &quot;Altaria Weekly&quot; catches your eye.</desc>

      <desc>   Fresh brewed iced tea is served in mason jars, with larger quart sizes for thirsty patrons. Above a relic cash register is a framed &quot;Certificate of High Achievement in Typoese&quot;  presented to Viki by Zargot.

      <name>Underground Black Market (LP-UP)</name>
      <desc>   The underground level is known for its seedy characters who stand on corners under dim street lamps and peddle five-finger discounts. It&apos;s damp and musky here, as there are no windows or any way for sunlight to reach this area. The only hint of natural light comes from underneath the door at the top of the rickety stairs that lead to the underground.</desc>
      <desc>   To the (W) is a door in need of a coat of paint, with an almost indistinguishable Oriental marking. To the (E) is a dimly lit store window with faceless mannequins donned in risque apparel. You shiver as a damp wind breezes down your collar. You hurry past a questionable peddler in a trench coat trying to show you watches for sale. You can buy almost anything here, look around, but be careful who you barter with... there are some very shady characters here.</desc>
      <desc>   The street continues (N) where the lighting is less than enticing. If you&apos;re still intact, along with your wallet, now might be a good time to leave.</desc>
