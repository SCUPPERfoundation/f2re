      <name>Pluto and Prosperpina&apos;s Private Chambers</name>
      <desc>     Here is the private residence of the God and Goddess of the Underworld.  Firelight flickers off of dark walls accentuate the fact that we are indeed underground in the land of the dead.  Instead of making the room feel gloomy however, they give the room a warm cozy feel.  There is a fireplace in once corner that gives the room light and warmth.</desc>
      <desc>     A large four poster bed dominates the center of the room with a mattress of deep soft space foam which molds itself to the sleepers form.  Each of the posters is gilded and covered in gems as symbols of all treasures hidden below the earth.  Rich soft chocolate colored leather drapes match the soft bedspread and pillows made of the same soft fabric.  The covers are turned down revealing soft satin sheets which create a cool very masculine but soft and oddly comforting effect.</desc>

      <name>Vulcan&apos;s Forge</name>
      <desc>     A blast of heat hits you as you enter the fiery blacksmith&apos;s workshop.  The Smithy is complete with a giant forge and bellows.  Most of the walls are covered in the various tools of his trade with many hammers of different shapes and weights used in different applications to pincers and leather pads used to hold and shape the metal once heated.  One wall is filled with hundreds of figures and delicate pieces of art work all cleverly crafted from the bounty of the underworld&apos;s mines.   It is difficult to imagine the craftsman who creates such fine artwork yet still possesses the strength to make the great lightening bolts that Jupiter uses to show his displeasure.  Several old blue prints of the ships he helped to build to bring mankind to Pantheon are also hanging on his walls.  Of course, they are encased in blast proof glass to protect them from the heat of the furnace.</desc>

Also, gifts of flowers and other over-worldly gifts have been left her to cheer up Prosperpina during her exile to the underworld each winter.  As Goddess of the Underworld, the once kidnapped Prosperpina now spends 6 months of each year in Hades and the other 6 with her Mother Ceres.  After she had recovered from the terror of her kidnapping and sudden marriage to Pluto, Prosperpina set straight to decorating the underworld so that she could stand the winter months away from her mother.  Pluto and Prosperpina&apos;s home lays beyond the altar behind a door guarded by Cerberus the massive three headed dog.  Only the dead are allowed to pass beyond its massive teeth.  Of course if you insist, your death can be arranged......</desc>

Closer examination reveals that there is no mattress. A dial beside the bed turns on an anti-grav field so that the occupant(s) can relax and sleep in complete weightlessness.  Several quilts are stacked to one side for those who still like something fluffy to cuddle up with.</desc>

      <desc>     Here, the atmosphere is decidedly more relaxed.  At the very least, its much less formal than the altar room below.  Venus comes up here when she needs to let down her hair and escape the constant devotion of her worshipers.  Off to one side is a dance floor made of a new, highly reflective yet damage resistant, mirro-plex surface which reflects the dancers perfectly while being able to display any number of graphic designs or patterns. It&apos;s punctuated by several highly polished poles and is surrounded by several dark padded booths.  A busty waitress stands ready to take your drink order.</desc>

He stands ready to receive and transport souls to their eternal reward for good or bad in the underworld . . . for a fee of course.  Those who have no coin to give the ferryman must wait for a hundred years before he will take pity on them and allow them to cross.  One such unfortunate soul stands here crying as she is unable to join her family in the underworld.  Charon eyes you warily, but since you are still alive, you seem to be of little interest to him.</desc>

Below a depiction of Venus Goddess of Love emerging from the waves on the event of her birth, is the altar dedicated to the Goddess of Love and Beauty.  Beside her is Cupid, God of Love.  Gifts of roses, sweet scented candles and incense burn from those hoping to find true love or in gratitude from those who have found it.  A serving girl in one corner stands ready with simu-ambrosia.  She promises it will ease the aches from your body without pesky godly side effects.  The main dome of the Pantheon is South.</desc>

      <desc>     The vast library stretches out in all directions before you as a sense of peace and order fills the air.  Tall floor to ceiling book shelves line the walls in this Shrine to Minerva Goddess of Wisdom, War, Learning, and the Arts.  The shelves are all very cleverly arranged so as to create separate rooms for each major subject area without actually having any walls.  There are several carts near the door labeled IN and OUT as well as a rather large and prominent sign that reads: &quot;Please do not bring food or drink into the library. Monetary donations are of course accepted.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>     It was Minerva that had suggested an attempted be made to reconstruct Rome with the help of mankind. &quot;What use is paradise without worshipers?&quot; she asked.  She also proposed that Saturn the God of Time should suspend it so that the humans could be brought over without the several generations it would normally take to make the crossing.

When the Gods saw that they had been replaced in ancient Rome, it was Juno, Queen of the Gods who had suggested and pushed for the move away from Earth to teach man a lesson.  So it is no wonder that her face is etched with an eternal scowl since mankind managed to reach the space age without their intervention.  Jupiter&apos;s image sits at her side holding a lightning bolt just in case anyone tries to tell his temperamental with &quot;I told you so.&quot;</desc>

      <name>Shrine to Mars</name>
      <desc>     The shrine to Mars, God of War was often a very bloody and gory affair in Ancient times.  Now, in the enlightened age of man, nothing much has changed.  Although most of the people who volunteered to remake Ancient Rome were scholars, architects, and historians, many Gods chose to bring dedicated worshipers along as well.</desc>
      <desc>     Mars, in concert with Vulcan, created the ships used to transport the people, animals and all forms of plant life and technology that would be needed to allow man to rebuild Rome in all its glory. Reproductions of those famous ships are available here for a modest fee and include the modern luxuries and safety upgrades required by the Galactic Administration for transit through the link.  Each ship is of course blessed by Mars himself to ensure the prosperity and success in battle of each owner.  Mars does not however guarantee safe passage through any celestial body and the user does so at their own risk.   The main dome of the Pantheon is West.</desc>

The vastness of Rome lays spread out before you as far as the eye can see.  A huge forest is visible to the southeast and you can just make out a path that leads through it.  In the far off distance you can hear the drums and see the great Roman Empire Coliseum where Gladiators fought to entertain the masses.  And the Via Sacra, running to the Forum which contains the Planetary Management complex, heads off to the South West.   You can go back down to the main level of the Pantheon via the stairs.</desc>

As you do so, you notice that the room is dimly lit by candles that dot the walls in tiny alcoves and various shelves and ledges and it takes your eyes a moment to adjust to the change of lighting. The warm dark wood paneled walls show true craftsmanship and are worn soft with care and the smooth stone tile floor is surprisingly warm beneath your bare feet.  The subtle smell of incense hangs in the air and you can see a small burner tucked off to one corner letting out the occasional drift of its fragrant smoke. A large leather padded table stands next to a shelf lined with a neat row of bottles of scented massage oils along with a bench on which to leave your clothing should you choose.  A hot tub takes up the remaining space, its steam warming the room making the air feel thick and rich.</desc>

A statue of his shininess is gilded and polished.  He is depicted here holding a lyre in one hand while riding his golden chariot across the sky.  He was the first to bring light into Kaos by snagging a nearby star to provide the warmth and light needed for light.  He also brought with him his knowledge of ancient music and cultural heritage of Ancient Rome making it possible to recreate it here on Pantheon.   A small door is in one corner of the alcove</desc>

It is also the only source of natural light in the building.  As the day goes by, a spot of sunlight travels around the interior of the dome highlighting several of the altars that have been set up around the dome.  There is a steady stream to traders and merchants going to and from the exchange which is East.  You may leave the Pantheon by going South.</desc>

Live grape vines that twine up the bar posts are descendent from the first cuttings propagated and cared for by Bacchus himself after the first crossing.  One end of the bar is dedicated as a shrine to Bacchus and, in addition to the usual accoutrements, contains a jar for collections to pay the God&apos;s rather hefty bar tab.  A waitress smiles and motions for you to take a seat where you like as she stands waiting patiently for newcomers to hmm and haw over the menu.</desc>
      <desc>    Pub Bacchus is modeled after the old drinking pubs in Ireland and England, and is not an authentic piece of ancient Rome. The Roman Empire did, at one time, extend to the British Isles.

      <desc>     A large lavishly decorated Archway dedicated to Janus stands here, at the entrance to the garden as doorways were his domain.   His shrine is now maintained by no more than a handful of worshipers as the gates are shut.  When at war, Romans would open the doors so as to be ready for his assistance in times of need.</desc>
      <desc>     At the entrance to the garden path a sign reads: For Your Own Safety And The Preservation of Tellus&apos;s Hard Work, Please Refrain From Leaving The Designated Paths.</desc>

      <desc>     You find yourself in a beautiful sunny clearing with the river rushing past, the wind in your hair, the earth beneath your feet, and a fire glowing on a stone hearth.  You have completed the journey to the place where the elements meet.  An altar to Iris, Goddess of Rainbows is here covered in gifts from the many pilgrims that travel here to cross the bridge and through the rainbow.  A pilgrim stands here worshiping her Goddess in a flowing multicolored robe.</desc>
      <desc>     You are also standing on the other side of the bridge that crosses the river.  From this angle you can see that the rainbow in the sky is being cast by the bridge itself as the sun shines through the crystaline structure.</desc>

A huge mahogany four poster bed with burgundy drapes takes pride of place in the center of the room. A giant fluffy home-made quilt is laying across it.  A closet stands ajar and you can see several changes of clothing ranging from t-shirts to sundresses laying all over the place. A fire burns in a corner fireplace that casts soft shadows around the room. The stairs lead back down to the living area.</desc>

Shelves and bookcases are filled with mementos from her travels along with rows and rows of, you guessed it, more books.  A quick glance at the titles on display reveals textbooks from college, many romance novels, books on Ancient Rome, and an entire row of &quot;For Dummies Books&quot; on every subject imaginable. A cat purrs contentedly on the throw rug in front of the fire. A stairway leads up to the bedroom; a sliding glass door leads South West to the terrace.

The Curia Julia or meeting place for the Roman Senate is located North West from here and serves as the office block for the Planet Administration offices.  The Temple dedicated to Hestia is East.

The eternal flame burns in the center and is never allowed to burn out.  Upon becoming chosen for the high calling for the position of Vestal Virgin at the age of eight, the women are expected to maintain their virgin state for 30 years service to Rome.  Upon completion of their service requirement they may choose to continue as a Vestal or may retire to take a husband.  You see a sign to one side that advertizes a tour of the temple quarters.</desc>

The place is decked out with cushions all over the floor with low tables for lounging at and eating.  Veils hang from the ceiling at strategic intervals to give privacy without the feeling of claustrophobia.  A shrine to the God Priapus stands in one corner and the exit to the temple of Hestia and the street is west.  Amongst the discarded clothing that can be seen strewn around the room are several sandals. A closer look tells you that at least one of them has little wings on it.</desc>

      <desc>Prometheus was one of the few Gods who dared argue against Juno&apos;s plan to abandon mankind and instead gave the gifts of wisdom and reasoning with the help of Minerva to them to see them through.  In addition to his earlier tricking of Jupiter into accepting fat and bones as offerings and his gift of fire to mankind, this latest conflict was the tipping point for the King of the Gods.</desc>
      <desc>Since Jupiter could not re-confine Prometheus to the Caucasus Mountains, Jupiter exiled Prometheus to stay on Earth with mankind stripped of all his Godly powers except his immortality.  When the space age began and Prometheus saw that mankind would succeed in spite of the God&apos;s desertion, he traveled to Pantheon to deliver the news.  The shrine here is dedicated to the God of healing and fire for the help he gave mankind through the centuries between ancient times and the space age.  You can see a replica of the Caucasus Mountains in the distance.</desc>

His small stature doesn&apos;t seem to bother him a bit since he is obviously otherwise well endowed.  Aside from the usual ritual paraphernalia on and around the altar, a large cabinet is set to one side full of various toys and accessories.</desc>
      <desc>     A massive four poster bed complete with virginal white drapes stands in the center of the room, its curtains billowing at the slightest breeze.  A sparkling white bedspread and lace pillow cases adorn the bed along with dozens of throw pillows.  A dial located on each side of the bed allows the sleeper to adjust the firmness of the mattress according to their own liking.  That is, if anyone ever got any sleeping done in here.</desc>

      <desc>      An altar dedicated to Ceres, Goddess of Agriculture, and to Tellus, Goddess of Earth, stands here.  The figure representing Ceres has a scepter in one hand and a basket full of fruit and flowers at her feet, as she rules over crops and planting.  Tellus, on the other hand, appears to be more motherly and kind, yet her intense eyes seem to follow you around the clearing.</desc>
      <desc>     Before there was organization in the system, Tellus found Pantheon and gave it life making it habitable for Gods and Mankind alike.  It was Ceres&apos;s special gift with grains and agriculture with Tellus&apos;s manipulation of the growing seasons that kept the people of  Pantheon fed while the Galactic Administration decided to allow the use of the link to transport goods.  The perpetual growing cycle now produces enough surplus grain to create a thriving agricultural economy, despite its halting entrance into the Interplanetary Federation.</desc>

Be warned, she greatly values her privacy and does not take kindly to being spied upon.</desc>
      <desc>     A statuesque representation of the Goddess stands near the altar surrounded by the animals of the forest and her loyal hunting dogs.  It was Diana&apos;s knowledge of animal husbandry that has made the forest a thriving community of plant and animal life and her nursing that brought them through the crossing from old Earth to Pantheon.</desc>

It is dyes from the herbs and flowers kept in perpetual bloom that lend their pigments to the clothing and paints throughout Pantheon.</desc>
      <desc>      In once corner you can see a shrine dedicated to the Goddess Flora who keeps the flowers in a constant state of blooming beauty.

During the move across space she was in charge of not only safely bringing her tree to Pantheon, but also for the health of all the trees that were brought over on the crossing.  It was her loving care that made the forest that surrounds you possible.  She has carefully tended her tree for centuries now and its size is incredible.  While most other dryads appear to be in the bloom of youth, Belidis appears to be in her late 20&apos;s early 30&apos;s.  Which isn&apos;t bad considering she has been around for several millennia.</desc>

The label near the dial reads: &quot;Press for Bubbles.&quot;  When you do so, you see that the bed is actually blowing a bubble mattress!
