      <desc>3.  Before building, check to ensure there are enough workthings to operate your factory and all existing factories.</desc>
      <desc>4.  All factories must be maintained at 100% efficiency at a minimum.  Any factory reaching 90% efficiency will be summarily expropriated.</desc>

      <desc>   &quot;Futures Trading is easy, but not the faint of heart.  I recommend reading the chapter in the Idiot&apos;s Guide on Futures Contracts and Stringbois&apos; Trader Tips article &lt;http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/manuals/tradertips2.html&gt;.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   &quot;With that as background, you should be aware that Futures Trading outside of Sol is a bit more complicated.  For one, the stock levels aren&apos;t limited to 700 tons, but rather to whatever level the Planet Owner wants to set it at.  Also, you can&apos;t assume that a Planet Owner is using a spread of 20% -- the divisor of .9 or 1.1 the tips article refers to.  Finally, a planet exchange&apos;s base price changes with each exchange cycle (there are roughly 200 exchange cycles daily).&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   The commodities in Arctic&apos;s exchange generally are set at a 40% spread.</desc>
