      <name>Hospital</name>
      <desc>Androids frantically scramble to build more pods as the wounded stream into the clinic. The floor is slick with blood despite the best efforts of the cleaning bots to keep it mopped up.</desc>
      <desc>A doctor grabs you and tells you to put your finger in the neck of a woman he is treating. Blood spurts from a severed artery there. If your stomach can&apos;t take anymore, the way out is south.</desc>

      <name>Pete&apos;s Hole in the Wall</name>
      <desc>A large cavernous space greets you as you barely make it inside before the doors are locked. There are groups of people here and there. Several people are shaking; obviously disturbed by something. You barely make out whispers. People muttering about the lack of protocols, safety rules violated, experiments gone wrong.</desc>
      <desc>A bar-droid smiles at you with a 14 karat mouth and asks your pleasure. You only want to know the way out, he informs you need only ask and he will see you get back to the LP.</desc>

      <name>Landing Pad</name>
      <desc>People running by screaming. Shuttles blasting off and landing again. The noise is very annoying running the gamut from silence to deafening blasts, it is not something one could ignore.</desc>
      <desc>A man runs by with a severed arm in hand. It appears to be his. He looks at you and begs, &quot;Please! Which way to the hospital!&quot;. You point him to the north and he nods heading off towards the hospital.</desc>
      <desc>Several people are running into the building to the east. A large sign  indicates it is the exchange.</desc>
      <desc>South is a wide street with people hurrying towards the LP. No one seems to be going the other way. Are you adventurous or level headed enough to leave it alone?</desc>
      <desc>An android is just closing the doors on the  bar to the west. If you hurry, you might make it inside before the doors close!</desc>

      <name>The Exchange</name>
      <desc>Lights flicker, highlighting the chaos inside this exchange. People screaming, some just staring blankly. Against the east wall there is a sturdy metal door. Something pounds on it from the other side in slow methodical rhythms.</desc>
      <desc>The way out is west.</desc>

      <name>Town Road North or South</name>
      <desc>In an attempt to make the bio-asteroid more liveable, engineers have created a Main street similar to that which can be found in the archives of Old Earth located in what were called &apos;amusement parks&apos; of the era.  Bots in long dresses and some in top hats and overcoats stroll contentedly along the sidewalks, smiling, chatting and laughing. It offers a rather strange juxtapose to the screaming, bleeding people running wild eyed towards the LP.</desc>

      <name>The Bio-Labs Complex</name>
      <desc>A woman in a white labcoat, stumbles towards you. Half her right arm is gone, the half remaining isn&apos;t severed cleanly. It looks a bit like it was melted. She grabs your arm, and you have little choice but to help her out the exit. You catch something large moving out of the corner of your eye, and a sucking sound, as if a giant snail moved. The walls to the east bow inwards, smoke appears and a hissing noise. Perhaps it would be best if you left now. The way out is southwest.</desc>

      <name>Professor Gitginous</name>
      <desc>The sobbing source is revealed here. A crumpled man in a stained labcoat sits on the ground holding his head, slowly shaking it back and forth proclaiming that he&apos;d done every thing right. When you inquire as to what it was he did, he looks up at you startled, obviously so taken with his own ruminations that he failed to notice your entrance.</desc>
      <desc>&quot;Well, it started in the genome lab. We&apos;d just found a way to reverse entitlicature a semi-dollituproid. It was such a small thing. We&apos;d had no idea it could...&quot; He shudders, &quot;It could... well we just had no idea!&quot; He grabs your arm. &quot;There&apos;s only one way to stop it! Someone has got to squeeze into the lab&apos;s trans space and disconnect it&apos;s power initiate.</desc>
      <desc>There is an entrance to the northeast, but it appears to be heavily guarded, and these guards are facing your way. Perhaps with the right credentials one might be able to enter...</desc>
      <desc>The only exit is south.</desc>

      <name>Fountain Square</name>
      <desc>A large fountain shooting various colored liquids high into the sky dominates this plaza. To the northeast is the official bio-labs complex. The building is the source of the annoying braying you&apos;ve been hearing since you got off the shuttle. Doors are guarded by several security officers. However, they are not facing you, they are facing the doors!</desc>
      <desc>Shops line the rest of the square, most announcing various touristy trinkets. The shop to the east shows various bio-engineered pets.  Southeast is a trinkets shop. Southwest is an ice cream vendor. South there is a path leading into a wooded area. The LP is north.</desc>

      <name>BIo Pets</name>
      <desc>Oscar (you know this from his name tab) welcomes you to his shop. He&apos;s rather manic and is covered in short red fur. He looks fuzzy and nice to hug until he grins and rows of sharp incisors wink at you.</desc>
      <desc>Bio-engineered dogs and cats look at you mournfully, yipping or yowling as they catch your eye. Stranger creatures line the other walls, combinations of different pets and some completely foreign to you are caged on the south wall. The way out is west.</desc>

      <name>Dining area</name>
      <desc>There are tables and chairs set up under red and white awnings. On the far side are various vendors selling edibles. Snake sausages, Petunia-pork pies, and other bizarre engineered delectables vy for your food groats. No one is visible, but there are soft sobs coming from the north. If you&apos;ve finally had enough you can leave by moving southeast.</desc>

      <name>Beth&apos;s Roadside Park and amusement rides</name>
      <desc>Behind the trees you can see an old fashioned amusement park complete with roller coaster, merry-go-round, and even a ferris wheel! The scent of roasting meats, spun sugar, and popcorn waft over you. The road continues south and north here.</desc>

      <desc>Bright and shiny toys, T-shirts, Balloons, whirling colored disks and lots of other things line the shelves of this small enclosure. A young woman (Trixie perhaps?) sits and watches a holo which looks like so much gobbledy-gook from your perspective. She seems totally unaware of the chaos errupting outside her shop. The way out is northwest.</desc>

      <name>The monster</name>
      <desc>A large, gelatinous, grey blob rustles toward you. It moves surprisingly fast. You&apos;d best leave by going east or, if you are completely insane, you can move to the northwest.</desc>

      <name>The Merry-Go-Round</name>
      <desc>Jangling music emanates from the center, as the smiling horses flash by much too quickly. There seems to be a rather loud rustling noise coming from the other side of the contraption. You can continue west or take the more sane route and go back east.</desc>

      <name>The Ferris Wheel</name>
      <desc>Lights flash, and the giant wheel turns rather quickly you think. Good thing there&apos;s no one on the ride. In fact, the entire area looks deserted. The road continues north or west here.</desc>
