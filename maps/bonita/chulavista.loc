      <desc>Peeping behind a screen you see doctors battling to save the life of someone who was shot. An insurance agent wrings his hands in despair, saying, &apos;Why didn&apos;t he get himself insured? What a tragic waste.&apos; You hope he&apos;s talking about the life, not the money.   The exit is south.</desc>

      <desc>The air is hot and dusty with a thick smell of wood fires and gun powder. While looking at the ramshackle buildings to the north, east and southwest, you wonder how this planet ever got it&apos;s beautiful name. &apos;DUCK DOWN&apos;  bullets are flying everywhere as you hear gunshots coming from the Cantina. Fortunately, you wern&apos;t hit - only grazed.</desc>
