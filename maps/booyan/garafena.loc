      <desc>   The masts carries the horizontal yards from which are slung the great canvas sails. The position of the sails can be controlled by hauling on the complex system of running rigging. Setting and furling the sails require the sailors to climb the masts and then to move out along the yard arms, high above the deck and even right out over the sea.  You see a few sailors climbing using the thin &apos;ratlines&apos; as steps that are strung between the main shrouds. The Mizzen Mast looks to be 170 feet tall and two feet in width.</desc>
