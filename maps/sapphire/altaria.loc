A dressing table with various brushes and combs along with hair pins and other such useful items. Beyond the table is a full closet and a full length mirror to admire the handywork of the Altarian tailors.</desc>

      <desc>   As you can see this is designed for the Master of the mansion in one corner of the balcony is a large hot tub, the jets causing the water to swirl and bubble to ease away the pains of the day and the light steam rolling off the surface lets you know that it&apos;s set at just the right temperature. At the opposite end a porch swing hangs from ceiling the lattice covering it is teeming with honeysuckle, although the scent is not overwhelming it is sweet and can be relaxing while you sit looking out over the yard. A table is centrally placed where one might have breakfast in the morning sun that filters through the lattice cover over the balcony.</desc>
      <desc>   A set of stairs will take you down to the pool if you prefer a swim over the tub, or you can go west through the french doors to the Master Suite.</desc>

Another of BB being kicked in the shin, a daily event by DropTop, and DT hopping around cause he kicked the peg leg rather than the good one.</desc>

      <desc>   As you step through the door the clatter of forks hitting  plates tells you this is a busy establishment. The waitress sees you standing at the entrance and smiles warmly at you. As she approaches you see her name tag reads Fifi Le&apos;Mew and wonder how odd it is to have a French waitress in a Chinese restaurant. As she takes you to your table you can see the chef through an open service area, dressed in his cap and apron as he stirs a huge wok. Fifi seats you near the back and you see a red telephone just inside the kitchen door with a small sign reading... &quot;Supply Hotline for use by Chow Linn only&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   You assume that must be the head chef&apos;s name.</desc>

      <name>Kingman&apos;s Office Apartment</name>
      <desc>   Large windows in each wall giving you a panoramic view in all directions flood the room in natural light. Of course there are heavy drapes to keep things private if he so chooses. Against the north wall is a bed for those occasions that he doesn&apos;t make it home. A large comfortable looking sofa is placed so that he may look out over the eastern valley and watch the sun rise as he is known to do at times. Also from this window you can see a new home on the opposite side of the valley, finally finished but not yet lived in. The southern view is spectacular looking out over the Altarian ocean.</desc>

      <desc>   As you enter the ambiance is a little overwhelming, soft lighting and a cozy central fireplace there are but a few tables for dining at this small bistro, the reservations must be hard to come by. The hostess seats you by a window looking out over the calm ocean, it&apos;s waters shimmering in the sunset and the soft music fills the air.</desc>

      <desc>   The desk clerk smiles at you as you enter the building and calls for assitance for your luggage. While checking in your eyes sweep the room and notice the lobby is decorated in an old world theme. Vacationers sitting in plush sofas and chairs lining the walls, and there&apos;s a fireplace in the center to ward off the chill of the cool nights. As the clerk hails a bellhop as he directs your attention to the restaurant to the west and asks if he can make some reservations for you.</desc>
