The view to the north reveals much of what once made up the inhabited regions of Halloween before the crisis forced the town to relocate.  It blends into the trees and foliage and if one didn&apos;t know what it was, it would appear to be natural formations of earth and rock.</desc>
      <desc>The sky is awash with a sea of stars, as if someone took a handful of glitter and tossed it across a canvas of dark velvet.  A jacuzzi is bubbling on the far edge of the balcony.  Climb on IN.</desc>

The wood paneled walls are covered in bright orange, purple and black cobwebs and seem to flicker a green hue along to the beat of the rather loud music - loud enough to wake the dead!  Party streamers hang loosely from the sconces and stretch across the club, back and forth in no observable pattern.  On the far wall, near the bar, is a banner that says, &quot;HAPPY HALLOWEEN.&quot;  The ghosts of celebrities and members past are mingling with the other party guests.  Avoid herecy and order a round of free drinks for the room then find yourself a comfortable seat in one of the booths or overstuffed, comfortable chairs.  If you feel rather festive, you can kick up your heels and dance along to the beat of the music.</desc>

      <name>The Haunted Trail</name>
      <desc>The trail is dark and a chill is in the air.  The wind blowing through the trees creates a mournful wail and the rustling branches give rise to the imagination making it appear as if something was moving about out there.  The trail continues into the darkness to the SOUTHWEST and towards the light to the NORTHEAST.</desc>

      <name>A Cabin in the Woods</name>
      <desc>A tidy log cabin lies nestled between the trees.  It once served as the home for the caretaker of the castle proper.  Now it sits abandoned and boarded up, its secrets locked away from the time when Halloween was a duchy.  A few paces from the house, there is a stone well, its rocks covered by centuries of moss and weeds, the handle to the crank to raise and lower the bucket for water has long since broken off and rests to the side, useless.</desc>
      <desc>There sits on the edge of the well a little girl plucking petals off a flower one by one and casting them into the well.  She hums a little tune to herself and seems innocent enough until approached when she places her flower down and her eyes glow a deep blood red.</desc>

      <desc>Rising above the surrounding landscape is a tall ancient castle.  Its ramparts stretch from tower to tower and the ancient stone shows its age as moss and ivy grow to cover its fading luster.  The tall, wooden door at the top of the stairs is bound by an enormous chain and lock, not allowing any entrance to the structure.  The main path leads off to the NORTH from here and there is a sign before a path to the EAST that reads &quot;Haunted Forest Path: DANGER.&quot;</desc>

A path opens up to the EAST and a bush that seems to have bits of cloth clinging to its branches is to the WEST.</desc>

      <name>Kelley&apos;s Pub</name>
      <desc>The lighting is dim in this old country pub.  The locals look up from their drinks, stopping their conversations at the sight of an outsider.  Behind the bar is a handsome lass, with flowing locks of reddish brown curls.  She looks your way and you swear there was a momentary red glow to her eyes.  You dismiss it as your eyes adjusting to the light.</desc>
      <desc>The pub is sparcely decorated but very functional.  The tables and chairs don&apos;t match, but the locals don&apos;t seem to mind.  On each table a single lantern rests, illuminating the wooden surface.  Find a seat and order a round to warm up the locals.  Outsiders are well to remain cautious, but a good drink is a nice offering to ease their tensions.  Perhaps you can become a regular and soak up local culture.</desc>

The sound of your footsteps echo against the walls of the buildings lining this portion of the street.  The only doorway open is to the WEST.

The trees of the forest form a tight barrier on both sides of the path making it difficult to go anywhere but where the trail leads.  The lilting sound of a concertina playing a salty jig fills the air but the path SOUTH is blocked by a watchman smoking a small pipe.  He grins and points towards the NORTH where the trees give way to a clearing.</desc>
