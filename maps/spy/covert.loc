Trainees receive extensive, ongoing psychological evaluations to determine their fitness for intelligence work.  Living a double life, especially directly lying to loved ones, is not for everyone.

      <name>Safe Room</name>
      <desc>The inn provides this unique safe room in certain room suites.  The walls consist of layers of hard steel lattice sandwiched around bullet resistant kevlar.  Flame retardant materials coat the walls.  Communications and exhaust systems as well as video surveillance are installed.  Better safe than sorry.  Exit SW.</desc>

      <name>Cloak and Dagger Guest Registration &amp; Lobby</name>
      <desc>You are greeted politely as you register for a room.  You fill in whatever name you wish to provide, include contact information if you wish to be contacted and present your form of payment.  The clerk asks nothing further as long as your credit is good.  Guests here do not welcome inquisitive staff, which presents no problem to Cloak and Dagger personnel who are trained above all to practice discretion.  Your room is UP to the right.  The reception is OUT through the archway.</desc>

      <name>Cloak and Dagger Guest Room</name>
      <desc>You enter the room by pressing your thumb against a scanner, which compares it to the print you registered.  You are impressed with the thick walls which thoroughly insulate you from your neighbors.  You may wish to scan the room for hidden devices that the inn staff may have overlooked.  The bed is large and firm and you notice the security panel that allows you to set motion detectors and laser perimeter alarms.  You are pleased to note there are no windows in this room, one less feature which would make you vulnerable.  The bathroom is East, the safe room is NE or you can go back DOWN to the registration lobby.</desc>

      <name>Bathroom</name>
      <desc>You quickly check the faucets and light fixtures for anything that doesn&apos;t belong, then take an appreciative look at the facilities.  Though merely an inn, not a luxury hotel, the Cloak and Dagger sees to its guests&apos; creature comforts.  The hot water is piping hot, the towels are soft and plush and the mirror runs from floor to ceiling on one wall.  The toilet articles provided have a pleasing lavender scent.   The jacuzzi tub is quite inviting.  Exit West.</desc>
