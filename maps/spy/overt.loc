      <name>Soapbox Meadow</name>
      <desc>Being open to new ideas or different points of view is considered an important quality for Overtians.  But sometimes it&apos;s hard to find an audience for avant garde or alternative thinking.  Thus was created Soapbox Meadow, where, once a week, people are given a half hour to discuss their viewpoints, their inventions, their take on the universe....anything they wish to address.  Some are considered crackpots and are listened to for amusement, while others have interesting notions that sometimes are embraced and taken further.  Exits are SE or SW.</desc>

      <name>Luminous Rock</name>
      <desc>On a planet virtually devoid of hills or mountains, there rises Luminous Rock, a luminescent marble monadnock surrounded by a plain.  A sculptor named Charles Bell who lived nearby is said to have gone nearly mad from cabin fever, one long, harsh winter.  When warmer weather finally arrived, he started erecting scaffolding all over Luminous Rock and began carving.  The project took 15 years, and at the end, Bell had created a bas relief sculpture 300 feet high, 200 feet across and recessed 30 feet into the rock.  The subjects of his sculpture were all manner of mammals, native to Overt.   Exits NE or South.</desc>

A group of friends talked one day and decided to open a store together where all the products would be made in local kitchens.  You can find canned tomato sauce, pressed cider, pickles and peanut butter....whatever the locals are growing and cooking.  Regulars come great distances to get their favorites.

The staff here also has unusual challenges, because many of the patients they treat have neglected conditions, again  because of a lack of proximity.

Though all the artists seek to portray the essence of their subjects, their methods of execution vary.  Some produce caricatures with exaggerated features.

      <name>Boundless Jumperport</name>
      <desc>Boundless is a seaside city, bordering the largest ocean on Overt.  Bays and inlets limit the useable land mass, so land is expensive.  Rentals are hard to come by and are snapped up before they&apos;re advertised.  Because of the expense, the bulk of the residents are in the technology and resource industries.   You can go IN the hoverferry to the Peninsula.  You can also go West.  The Jumper can take you back UP to Jumper Junction.</desc>

      <desc>Romance is the dominant theme at the best fine dining restaurant in Crystal City.  Anniversaries, birthdays, engagements are all celebrated with finesse.  Exquisitely prepared dishes coupled with the finest wines from Corkscrew, the soft sounds of the pianist, softly flickering candles all combine to create a perfect evening for loving couples.  The linens are crisp and white, the silverware highly polished, and the china is transluscent.  An evening spent here is unforgettable.  Exits NW or NE.</desc>

      <name>Oceana Restaurant</name>
      <desc>Decorated to look like you&apos;ve stepped on an ocean liner, the floor to ceiling windows give you an unobstructed view on the water.  You first see a tantalizing raw bar with an array of no less than four varieties of oysters, plus clams and Overtian mussels.  You can order grilled whole fish like halibut, swordfish and striped bass with spectacular sauces such as Hollandaise or tomatillo salsa.  Sole is prepared and fileted table side.  When you&apos;ve had your fill you can go back UP the pier.</desc>
