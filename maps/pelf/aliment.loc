      <name>Barn</name>
      <desc>A traditional-looking red barn, it has stalls along one wall to hold horses, cows, and maybe a goat or two.  On the other side of the barn is mostly farming equipment.  The floor is of hard-packed dirt and you can smell fresh cut hay in the air.  At the back of the barn is a ladder that will take you UP to the Hay Loft.</desc>

      <desc>It&apos;s dark and warm up here.  You hear mice scurry through the loose hay that covers the floor.  Along the walls bales of hay are stacked and you can taste the slight tang of salt in the air.  A few spots where the hay isn&apos;t stacked all the way to the roof look like great places to take a quick nap or have a tryst with someone special.</desc>

There are several old and battered leather chairs scattered around the room with little wooden tables beside them piled with books.  There&apos;s a fireplace in the near wall and a large bear-skin rug in front of it that looks very inviting.  Instead of candles for lighting there are low-hanging light fixtures.  It&apos;s difficult to tell if they are gas, oil, or electrically powered.</desc>

      <desc>What a bright and sunny room!  The lemony-yellow walls and the floor to ceiling windows that look out onto the pond are the perfect way to start your day.  The white painted tables and chairs match the sideboards and shelves in this room.  Tea pots, vases, and various other types of porcelain in many distinctive patterns perch daintily on the shelves.

A fresh breeze is blowing in from the window making the pink ruffly curtains flutter.  In the corner is P.I.T.A.&apos;s docking station, and the shelves along the wall are filled with little bunny knick knacks.

From the far corner you can smell a yeasty bread on the rise.  Over by the sink you see another droid peeling vegetables, and over on the stove top it smells like a chicken soup is simmering away.  All the appliances are top of the line 20th century Earth-style models.  In the middle of the kitchen is a very large wooden table that looks like it&apos;s been in use for generations.  On one end of the table is a fresh-baked pie and a large bowl of fruit.  On the other end is another droid mixing ingredients for what looks like a cake.</desc>
