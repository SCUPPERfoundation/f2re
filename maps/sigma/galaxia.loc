      <desc>Turrian developed a taste for the comfort of bars during his time in Sol and especially enjoyed spending time at the Wine Sink on Sauterne. This room while not complete already has monitors in place not only for playing games but also to monitor the movements of the planetary stock market. He has even hired a human serving girl to bartend and serve the drinks to himself and his guests, to maintain the atmosphere guests are charged for drinks. Several couches and lounge chairs face the monitors. And there are also several tables spaced throughout the room. A bar sits in the Northeast corner of the room and windows look out onto the Galaxian landscape. To the South is a bookshelf with the beginnings of a reading collection and some board games. Set into the ceiling is a closed iris type door. A set of french style doors to the North open onto a terrace. Arches lead Southwest and Southeast.</desc>
