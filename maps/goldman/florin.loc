      <desc>From the top of the office building, you can see a vast, dense forest extends in every direction.  In fact, all you can see is a see of green leaves from horizon to horizon.  Gone is any trace of a landing pad or any shuttles making the traverse to orbit.</desc>
      <desc>  A lite breeze licks the observation platform, occasionally gusting and blowing debris off the edge of the building.  You should watch your step, lest you should fall off.</desc>

      <name>Zarquad&apos;s Private Patio</name>
      <desc>  A wooden deck leads away from the main residence.  The sun hangs near the horizon in a permanent sunset over the distant ocean, giving the patio a dramatic light.  Several deck chairs are arranged to watch the celestial show.  To the right of the deck chairs, with an equally dramatic view, is a large hot-tub with dozens of jets of water to soothe the sorest of muscles.</desc>

      <name>The Trophy Room</name>
      <desc>   This large room is completely empty except for a large pedestal.  On the pedestal stands a large crystal trophy.  Below the trophy is a brass plaque, but it is currently blank.</desc>
      <desc>   On the walls are pictures of the many Fedizens who have helped Zarquad progress through the ranks: Kalandra, Trilleth, Jezz, Joe, Andrew, Kblackdragon, Meteu, and Silvos as well as  Hazed, Freya, and Bella in prominence directly behind the crystal trophy.</desc>

      <name>Zarquad&apos;s Office</name>
      <desc>   You have made your way into Zarquad&apos;s planetary control center.  Decorated in a mix of classic styling and modern conveniences.  The hardwood floors with selected oriental rugs scattered around set the tone for the room, while the forest green walls and deep rich cherry trim provide a feeling of warmth to the room.  </desc>
      <desc>   On southern part of the room, a large oaken desk dominates the space with an enormous leather chair.  The desk is covered with digital tablets showing a variety of information to complement the dizzying array of displays around the room.</desc>
      <desc>   On the northern half of the room is a comfortable lounge area consisting of several leather chairs gathered around a low oaken table.  A waitdroid waits to fill your order while you discuss affairs with the overlord.</desc>
      <desc>   When not here, the management can be contacted at zarquad@gmail.com.</desc>

      <name>West Wing reception</name>
      <desc>  You stand in the grand reception hall of the Planetary Management Offices.  The room is sumptuously decorated to show Zarquad&apos;s position in the world.  In the middle of the room is a large glass desk with the requisite data terminal on one side.</desc>
      <desc>  A pretty young receptionist, in proper Ferengi attire, sits at the desk and addresses you upon entering, &quot;Greetings, visitor.  Overlord Zarquad is out at the moment, but if you&apos;d like to take a seat, we expect him back shortly.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>   There are doors that lead north, west, and south in addition to the exit to the east.</desc>

      <name>Castle Courtyard</name>
      <desc>   You stand in the main courtyard of a very large and very old castle.  The ivy grows high over the stones of the keep.  The courtyard is surrounded by high walls with parapets and guard towers, but surprisingly, no guards.  The drawbridge has long rotted away and there is no trace of it.  Through the main gate, you see the moat and the forest beyond it, without any sign of a road or path to reach the castle.</desc>
      <desc>   There are two doors here.  The west door has a brass sign next to it that reads &quot;Planetary Management&quot; and the east door has a large red sign that reads &quot;Authorized Personnel Only.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>  To the right of the securely and permanently sealed portcullis is a large book.  The title and author are worn away, but the cover displays a picture of a spaceship docking at a futuristic landing pad.</desc>

      <desc>You stand in the grand hallway leading to Zarquad&apos;s private residence.  The floor is of grand marble with flowery carpet runners running to every exit.  A large, golden chandelier hangs above your head, lighting the room.</desc>
      <desc>   Guards stand posted at all of the exits, ready to keep the undesirables out.  Only the truly worthy, who understand Zarquad&apos;s greatness, are allowed past.</desc>

The private offices are only for worshippers of Zarquad and no one else.&quot;  When he releases you, he makes it clear that your only option is to exit the guard house by going out to the courtyard.</desc>
