      <name>On top of the dais</name>
      <desc>You are standing on top of a raised stone dais in an impact crater on the desolate planet&apos;s surface near the easterly wall of the crater. You can see your shuttle to the west. The distant walls of the crater still obscure all view of what lies beyond. Looking up you can see stars beaming through the thin atmosphere and they appear to be laughing at you, looking down you see footprints in the fine dusty soil leading off to the south, southwest, west, northwest and north. &quot;Well I guess it was worth a try wasn&apos;t it?&quot; you say out loud.</desc>

      <desc>You are standing in an impact crater on the desolate planet&apos;s surface near the northwesterly wall of the crater. You can see your shuttle to the southeast. The distant walls of the crater obscure all view of what lies beyond but obviously this is not a hospitable planet. The air is thin, barely enough oxygen to sustain life and is due to the very sparse vegetation. Looking up you can see stars beaming through the thin atmosphere, looking down you see footprints in the fine dusty soil leading off to the east, southeast and south. You notice a strange pile of rocks on the crater floor by the wall, but upon closer inspection realize that it is the skeletal remains of some strange creature that must of fallen in the crater and couldn&apos;t get out.</desc>

      <desc>You are standing in an impact crater on the desolate planet&apos;s surface near the northeasterly wall of the crater. You can see your shuttle to the southwest. The distant walls of the crater obscure all view of what lies beyond but obviously this is not a hospitable planet. The air is thin, barely enough oxygen to sustain life and is due to the very sparse vegetation. Looking up you can see stars beaming through the thin atmosphere, looking down you see footprints in the fine dusty soil leading off to the south, southwest and west. You glance around and see that someone has scrawled something on the crater wall. A closer look reveals the words &quot;You better leave now or you will never get out!&quot; together with a scratched arrow that points to the south. You step back and ponder the meanings of those words.</desc>

The distant walls of the crater obscure all view of what lies beyond but obviously this is not a hospitable planet. The air is thin, barely enough oxygen to sustain life and is due to the very sparse vegetation. Looking up you can see stars beaming through the thin atmosphere, looking down you see footprints in the fine dusty soil leading off to the north, northeast, east, southeast and south. You notice a strange carving in the crater wall. Upon a closer look you see a heart with an arrow through. The letters Z + J are scribed inside of the heart. Obviously some star-crossed lover left his mark.</desc>

      <desc>You are standing on the planet&apos;s surface near the southeasterly rim of a large impact crater. You can see your shuttle down in the crater below you. The air is thin, barely enough oxygen to sustain life and is due to the very sparse vegetation. Looking up you can see stars beaming through the thin atmosphere, looking down you see footprints in the fine dusty soil leading off only to the southeast. Looking back up you see the reason. There, off in the distance, is the airlock door to a small habitation complex. In this desolation you should probably go where there is shelter, hopefully something to eat, and maybe even someone to talk too.</desc>

      <desc>You are standing on the planet surface just ouside the airlock door of the Ofi Lusa Biological Research Facility. A well traveled footpath leads off to the northwest. You see no other indications that people stray off the beaten path and why should they? The air is thin, barely enough oxygen to sustain life and is due to the very sparse vegetation on the planet. You should either head back to your ship or go into the research facility. Idling around outside can not be good for your health.</desc>

      <name>Station Airlock</name>
      <desc>You are standing inside the research facility&apos;s airlock. The interior is painted a drab gray color. The atmospheric pressures inside the airlock is automatically adjusted by proximity sensors near the outer door and the hatchway to the southeast leading into the research facility. The air pressure difference in the station and outside is small and the automatic adjustments are almost instantaneously. Safety sensors make sure that both the door leading out and the hatchway into the research facility cannot be opened at the same time.</desc>

Two double tiered bunk beds are aligned with two of the walls, while three android regenative stations are attached to the third wall. All the fixtures and furniture are gray and drab and at the moment no one is using the facilities. The compartment&apos;s exit is to the south.</desc>

      <name>Cafe and Aid Station</name>
      <desc>You are standing in the facility cafe and aid station. Even within this modern research facility you can still get your food and or beverage made to order. You laugh to yourself when you notice a sign over the cooking area that says &quot;WELCOME TO OFI LUSA BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FACILITY. IF OUR ENZYMES AND TOXINS DON&apos;T KILL YOU, MAYBE OUR FOOD WILL!&quot; The chef walks over and says &quot;Hello there stranger, my name is Doc. You here for a meal or some mending?&quot; You look at him with a silly grin and sit down. &quot;Well let me know when you decide&quot; Doc says with a grin and walks away. He looks back over his shoulder and says &quot;We also have cloning insurance iffen you need that also, let me know.&quot; You look around and see several small cloth covered tables and chairs and some brightly colored paintings and posters on the wall. A welcome change from the gray drab scheme of the rest of the facility. Only the exit to the east remains gray and drab.</desc>

      <desc>You are standing in the central core area of the research facility. The bulk of the interior is a dull gray color with conduits and ductways running the everywhere. The low lighting casts an eeire pall over the interior and the fixtures. Five closed hatchways to the north, east, south, west and northwest can be seen. Only the hatchway to the northwest gives any indication what is beyond as the words &quot;CAUTION&quot; and &quot;AIRLOCK&quot; are stenciled across its width. A light above the airlock hatchway glows green at the moment.</desc>

      <name>Laboratory</name>
      <desc>You are standing in the research facilities main lab. Except for the lab equipment everything else is gray and drab appearing. You can see closed hatchways to the northeast, east and southeast which lead to the three small biological labs on the facility. Since the production of biological agents, enzymes and toxins may be dangerous to organic beings, only the station&apos;s android reseachers may enter into the smaller lab rooms. Their two human counterparts are monitoring their progress through data and the visual feed posted on each lab&apos;s monitor as well as talking directly with the researchers through comm links. Each team member is an important part of this facility&apos;s accomplishments and you can tell they work very well with each other. You sense that an important experiment is taking place and should probably leave. A closed hatchway to the west has the word &quot;EXIT&quot; stenciled across its width.</desc>

      <name>Commodity exchange</name>
      <desc>You are standing in the facility&apos;s commodity exchange. You know that the planet does not have the capacity nor the diverse needs to warrent such an elaborate trading environment. You seek out the exchange manager who explains to you that because of governmental funding cutbacks the research facility has had to try innovative approaches to fund their continuing research. Hence a trading exchange was established sometime ago to assist in the facility&apos;s funding shortcomings. He further tells you that he hopes you will be a regular visitor to the exchange. &quot;Those guys over there&quot;, pointing to the research area, &quot;are doing some great work on creating enzymes that produce a great chocolate and well as a killer synth-coffee extract&quot; he says. &quot;It would be a shame if their work had to be stopped due to budget constraints.&quot;  You thank him for his time and walk over to a trading console. Perhaps there is something you can buy or sell here. The exit to the exchange is north.</desc>
