      <name>Overlooking the Ocean</name>
      <desc>    There is a rail to the north of this area, making sure no one falls off the cliff face and down into the ocean below. The ocean itself seems to stretch onward to eternity, the dark blue color seems to only shift every once in awhile with the wind that passes through. The beach below seems riddled with rocks and other nasties making it impossible to head down without hurting themselves. To the south is the rest of the platform.</desc>

      <name>Through the Rocks</name>
      <desc>    The rocks themselves are scattered around the towns people unable to get rid of them when they had made the deck. The wind here whips around, pushing people around a little. To the north you can hear the sound of an ocean, waving lapping at the shore line. To the southwest you can see the forest in the distance, and hear howling slightly. To the south is the mountain path downwards.</desc>

      <name>Overlooking the Forest</name>
      <desc>    Handrails cover the south section of this area, looking over the large forest nestled into the mountains that surround the city limits. As a wind whips through, black birds seem to scatter into the air, leaving behind the sound of cawing in their wake. The only other noises from the forest below is the occasional sound of howling and barking as you can see specks of white and grey wolves in between the trees. To the northeast heads back to the platform.</desc>

      <desc>    The wind whips around up here, blowing everything and anything around in almost a vortex type motion. There are handrails here to assist people, as are guards seeming to be stationed for protection as well as help. The area here is a large wooden platform that seems to have been made as a look out deck, rocks are in the way to the north but you can climb through them if you wish to see more of the deck. You can go down the mountain too.</desc>

The path up the side of the mountain is steep but it seems hand rails were put in to help those who can not make the climb without an assitant. You can climb up the mountain or down.</desc>

The sound of the ocean seems to reach you here, along with howling in the distance. Guards seem to be posted every one hundred feet seeming to make sure the people visiting were protected. You can climb up the mountain or go to the south of the path.</desc>

The traffic here seems to be almost no one, as the path leads either up into the mountains once more or down into the market place. Snow falls still collecting on the ground piling up slightly seeming to stack up on either side of the pathway making it more enclosed. South is the Lower Market and southwest is the Market place proper.</desc>

On the back wall is a buffet like setting, with several different kinds of food set out all along it, with plates on either side to take and fill with food. Pitchers of mulled wine, and ale sit on the tables along with stacks of glasses for people to pour themselves. People pay the woman in the front before going to get some food.

      <desc>      The road is cobble stone, and people sit behind booths where their wares are set out and they call to the people on the street to buy something. Pieces of jewelry, and fine clothing are sold here and there. Along with small boxes of scented candles and rocks they seem to mine out. Children dressed up, and playing with very expensive looking dolls and wooden swords run down the streets. Playing with one another, seeming to be bouncing around only occasionally being yelled at by the adults. There is a building to the west, with a sign on it that says it&apos;s a Estari Restaurant, lovely smells of roast beef and chicken seem to come from the open door of the restaurant. To the northeast the market place continues as it does to the south.</desc>

Children dressed in only rags ran down the streets, either for fun or they were running from an adult. There is a building to the east, with a sign on it that says it&apos;s open for business, there are flowers in the windows making you wonder what they sell there.

A young woman stands behind the counter, arranging a new bouquet. She smiles up at you, asking you quietly if you would like a free flower, and to pick any flowers that you wish.

There are a few books shelves too, lined with leather bound old books of the planet&apos;s past. Wolf skin rugs are lying in the corner ready to be sold as well, fur coats also line the walls.

Their kids some smaller than others playing snowball fights in the yards.</desc>

You hear a small barking noise in the cave and come across a small wolf with gray fur, lying in an odd way as if its hind leg is injured. It barks and growls at you as you approach but when it moves it whimpers loudly. You can head back out of the cave where you came from since the howling has gotten louder and you may want to flee.</desc>

The letters glow slightly when a monster tries to enter the village, they glow almost a firey red color.</desc>

Large trees stretch over the pathway shielding it from the sun, and the snow that still falls from the sky. The trees glisten white from the snow. Unfortunately the trees cast a shadow over the path, so that when the wind does blow, it creates almost a wind tunnel. You may head down the path, or up it.</desc>

Snow drifts down from above looking like tiny flecks of white against the crystal blue sky. The snow swirls in the air as the wind blows in a fierce gale towards the small village below. There is a stone path with large trees lining it heading down towards the village, the leaves on the branches are gone, but snow covers the trees making them glint white in the sunlight. To the south is the exchange tent the multicolored cloth billows out as another gale rushes through the plateau. As you look down you see an entire village below you, lights twinkling on and off in the twilight hours. The sun heading down in the sky, casting the village in a sort of pale white glow.</desc>

You would think the fire would burn the tent down but you over hear someone saying that the cloth was coated with a magic spell making them non-flammable and the hole in the roof was enough to vent the smoke out as to not disturb the many traders and merchants coming and going here. A large screen is to the south end of the tent and scrolls the prices and commodities list for people to buy and sell. To leave the tent and go back to the landing pad you head North from here.</desc>
