A large monitor in the center wall is labeled &quot;Futures-Pick-of-the-Day&quot; for displaying those futures with particularly good values. (The screen is presently dark.)</desc>

      <desc>  The dockmaster scans your manifest to ensure you have proper authorization to sell commodities to New Ark; looks at you very closely with narrowed eyes and after a shrug and a dismissive gesture, stamps your papers and activates a trading console.</desc>
      <desc>  Placards showing surplus commodities that being sold are on the WEST bulkhead, while those commodities being purchased are on the EAST bulkhead. Commodities with a net zero can be bought or sold. A futures trader&apos;s lounge is NORTH.</desc>

      <name>Nark Station Docking Bay</name>
      <desc>  The docking bay for New Ark Station, or simply known as Nark by its residents, is cavernous, with enormous piles of stuff heaped around the bay.  Preparations are being made to undertake an epic journey to the ends of the Galaxy.  Unfortunately, preparations have been in progress for the past fifty years and the launch date has yet to be determined.</desc>
      <desc>  Automated work orders to purchase large quantities of supplies for the journey are still being placed, and you join the crowd of merchants eager to bring commodities, or haul away the surplus, at the exchange module to the NORTH.</desc>
      <desc>  The resident watering hole is SOUTH, and a station sick bay is WEST.  A passageway leading towards the working center of the station is EAST.</desc>
