      <desc>You are surrounded by men.  Hot, sexy men.  Most have shed their clothing; all have shed their inhibitions.  The music is loud.  Rhythmic, hypnotizing, unrelenting.  The crowd moves as one to the beat of the music.  Thrusting forward then retreating.  Over and over.  Beat...beat...beat...beat</desc>

      <name>Rainbow Lounge</name>
      <desc>Everyone who comes to Rainbow at some point comes to the Rainbow Lounge.  The signature drink is a Rainbow Rum.  Each layer is a color of the rainbow, with a different flavor rum.  The music is irresistable.  And look at those two hot guys dancing on your left!  Makes you wanna just jump right in.</desc>

      <desc>Even though Rainbow is clothing optional, the Hangar does a brisk clothing business.  Need a costume to express your inner self?  Its here.  Need some sexy pants?  Got em.  Want a silky, shimmering top?  Not a problem.  Swim wear?  Well, if you really think its necessary....</desc>

      <name>Rainbow House</name>
      <desc>You enter a room with the lights turned down low.  The music has a thrusting beat to it....bam...bam...bam.  Has a mesmerizing rhythm to it.  A hot waiter with no shirt offers you the planet signature drink...Rainbow Rum.  As you stand there with the glass, a sexy lady steps up to you, runs her fingers down you arm, and whispers in your ear with a soft sultry voice &quot;Hey there, stranger.  Want a girl to show you a good time?&quot;  Before you can answer, a god-like man wearing a silky shirt open to the navel and tight leather pants join you.  &quot;I can rock your world like an earth quake!&quot;  Obviously the employees of Rainbow House are prepared to satisfy any desires you might have....and  put a smile on you to last a light year.</desc>

      <name>Spacey&apos;s Toy Chest</name>
      <desc>To the left are all sorts of bottles and tubes containing any manner and color of liquids and gels.  Some of the labels advertise extra slick action, others a bit more traction.  The galactic favorite &quot;Super Slick&quot; is well stocked.  This one is moving!  Label says, &quot;For external use only.  Beware intense reactions&quot;.</desc>
      <desc>Next shelf has row after row of condoms.  Medium, Large, Max....Extra Small (non-descript packaging, of course).  Wait, is this one cant be for a human....the Trio?!</desc>

      <name>Meteu&apos;s Weapons</name>
      <desc>The view out the windows behind the desk is amazing....overlooking the pool area with all those naked, tanning (endowed) bodies surrounding it.  Your eye is drawn to the art work on the walls. To your left is a life sized painting, surreal, but you can tell its two people embraced in each others arms.  To your right are two pictures, each with a single individual, ripped toned bodies, facing each other, and obviously very excited to see the other.  Help yourself to whatever you find in the bar, and do enjoy yourself.</desc>

      <name>Rainbow Shuttle Port</name>
      <desc>Not the busiest place in the galaxy.  But then most residents and visitors dont conduct their business in the middle of the shuttle port.</desc>
      <desc>Everyone is welcome on Rainbow.  And it attracts quite a diverse group.  The only travel advice is to be aware that intolerance is not tolerated.  A cute young man wearing not much at all offers directions:</desc>
      <desc>&quot;If you&apos;ve come for business rather than pleasure, the Rainbow Exchange is directly east.  The Health Clinic is directly south.  But most visitors favor the entertainment district to the north&quot;  he says with a wink as he returns to his station.</desc>

      <name>Rainbow Pool</name>
      <desc>When a break from the hectic office life is in order, what better place than the Rainbow Pool.  The sun is always bright.  The temperature perfect.  And the water just right.  But the best asset is the view.  Naked and nearly naked bodies line the deck area.  Tanned....toned....exposed.  Unload the burden of your clothes....grap a rainbow rum from the bar....and join in.</desc>

      <name>Piradon&apos;s Paradise</name>
      <desc>As you enter, you cant help notice the view out the windows.  An array of hot, sexy, tanned, mostly naked bodies sorrounding the pool.  But eventually you tear your eyes away and take in the rest of the room.  An ell shaped couch is arranged so those on it can enjoy that wonderful pool view.  And what a specimen is taking advantage of the view!  Long silky red hair, toned athletic body wrapped in slinky almost big enough running shorts and top, long sexy legs .... amazing eye candy.  The walls are adorned with art that does its best to compete with the art on the couch, but it really doesnt measure up.  Help yourself to whatever (and whomever) you find here, and do enjoy yourself.</desc>

      <name>Cave</name>
      <desc>The passage way is through a slit not unlike a tent flap....you pull one piece of cloth like material back, then the other.  Its dark, but still enough light to see your surroundings.  The walls are like a silk cloth, very smooth and sexy.  In front of your, staring with its one eye, is the occupant of this cave.  It has a big head, kind of reminds you of a mushroom, but with that one eye.  Is it crying?  The body is long and rigid, and ends in a furry patch.  You reach out and it makes a little twitch at your touch.</desc>
