      <desc>   A skylight allows the room to bask in the sun&apos;s rays during the day and stargazing at night. It can be opened by means of a rope to allow fresh air to circulate throughout the room. A mirrored wall behind a room length bar is to the south and a door stands directly across from you. Chairs and tables are placed before a picture window allowing a spectacular view of the ocean where it meets the northern plains of Lyon.</desc>

      <desc>   Sunlight filters through the wooden blinds to rest upon a chair placed behind a large mahogany desk. Portraits adorn the walls except where an odd looking weapon hangs menacingly behind the desk, looking something like a shepherd&apos;s crook only the hooked end is a sharpened steel blade and the the opposite end sports a spiked ball. You shudder thinking of the damage it would do to flesh and bone. A small bar sits alone in the one corner and you can here a faint melody piped in from an unseen source. A large sofa sits beneath the window with a few furs thrown loosely over the back.</desc>

      <desc>   You push open the huge doors and step in as the cool inerior air rushes past you in its flight to gain the warmth outside. A single desk sits before the south wall and the lioness smiles briefly at you as she continues her work. The walls are covered in rich tapestries, some showing volcanoes belching fire and lava into the air and others of steaming oceans and lakes. Deep plush chairs line the walls for visitors to sit and discuss matters of importance.</desc>
      <desc>   To the northwest is an office door as well as one to the northeast.</desc>

      <desc>   You step upon the bottom step of the capitol and immediately go rigid with the feeling of being watched. Glancing about, you find the source of your tension as you spot the great lion statues poised in a crouching position on either side of you, their eyes seeming to follow your every move. It is rumored that Leostada can call them to life in times of great need and if the gods of his people feel so inclined.</desc>
      <desc>   As you continue up the steps you marvel at how the hand hewn blocks of the building fit perfectly upon one another, nearly seamlessly. Your eyes are drawn to the detail of the carved stone entrance, depicting hunting lions in the vast grasslands and hills.  A set of double doors lead into the building their brass bindings and hinges shining brightly in the sun in contrast to the dark yew wood doors.</desc>

      <desc>   Palm trees line the courtyard of the office building, their fronds swaying gently in the breeze. The paved surface is laid out in brick in circular pattern surrounding a fountain spraying water into the air where it hangs for a moment before falling back into the pool while lilies float at its edge dancing with the gentle splash of the water. Stone benches placed about the courtyard allow visitors to sit and take in the beauty of the flora growing close by. Large red irises standing behind deep purple orchids offset the green of the palm trees and small white flowers cover the entire ground around them.</desc>

      <name>Supply Hut</name>
      <desc>   Since this is the only place to buy goods on the shuttle pad, everything is housed in one fairly large hut. To your right is a small eatery, nothing more than a few tables placed in a corner, but it does have a nice view of the beach below and the goings on there. At the back of the Hut is a native woman selling Island trinkets and clothing suitable for the Island and the warm days on Lyon. Dressing booths made of bamboo with cloth draped doors are also provided. To your left is a man sitting behind a long table with radios and equipment you might find useful in exploring the Island. Although a little crowded, it must serve its purpose well as there are so many people milling about and looking at different items for sale here.</desc>

      <desc>   As you step from your ship the brilliant colors of the scantly clad citizens nearly blinds you, their minimal clothing ranging through all the shades of the spectrum, the climate here warm but pleasantly so. Their warm smiles welcome you as they continue about their work directing visitors and directing them to their destinations.</desc>
      <desc>   The dense jungle completely encloses the business center of Lyon from the rest of the planet. A trail of some sort leads you off to the southeast, if you can manage to push through the thick jungle. You can see the exchange to the east, with its open air styling and waitresses rushing about to serve their patrons. To the west is the supply hut and again its open air styling lends to further make your stay comfortable. South of you is the medicine hut where you can cure most local ailments and to the north stands the only stone structure in sight.</desc>

      <desc>   A man rushes past you as you enter the Exchange, all around you see crates of commods stacked and waiting to be loaded into shuttles. Looking out the window you see tanned muscular men carrying crates from the beach where they are transported from the main Island to the Exchange by large outrigger canoes. The exchange master is standing close by, checking labels on each crate and marking it down to keep track of the what&apos;s going out and what&apos;s coming in.</desc>

Seagulls and pelicans skim the surface of the water looking for their dinner, as you watch them you realize that you too are hungry and hope there is a place to dine on the Island. The canoes along the beach rock back and forth, the gentle waves splashing at their sides while the oarsmen patiently wait for you to get in.</desc>

In the moonlight, you can make out the silhouette of a pelican perched sleeping on the stern of one of the grounded canoes. A sanderling runs in and out with the surf, probing its bill in the wet sand in search of invertebrates.</desc>

The sun finally drops below the horizon and bathes the Island in a fragile semi-darkness. What follows is not so much night, but a lilac afterglow that in a few hours will be the prelude to sunrise.</desc>

As the canoe gets in motion for your return to the western Islet, sunset is on the horizon as the Island revolves away from the sun. The sky is laced with bright-colored scarves, and soon the twilit, peach sky becomes a crimson wound.</desc>

You&apos;re inside an open-air cabana facing the beach, with a thatched roof of coconut fronds. A bar spans the middle where a beach-clad, tanned bartender flashes his pearly whites as he serves colorful drinks with little parasols. You hear the sounds of raggae music from a transistor radio on the bar, adding to the island atmosphere of the cabana. Tourist and natives of the island sit on barstools eating roasted peanuts from wooden buckets on the bar and tossing the shells on the floor... go ahead, toss those hulls, its tradition here.</desc>

As they shove off, the waves breaking on the beach make a gentle sloshing sound against the canoe sides. The oarsmen put their strong arms and backs to work and the canoe swiftly accelerates eastward through the water, the bow bobbing up and down with their strokes.</desc>

Taking in your surroundings, you see that the shape of the island is elongated, extending mostly toward the southeast from the landing. Gazing toward the northeast, you see a lagoon. Further east, the elevation of the island is higher, with mountains topped with jungle vegetation and granite cliffs that extend into the ocean. Looking around, the white sands that line the shore of the island appear to fade into a mass of jungle palms.</desc>

As you tread water, your  movement attracts a small school of dolphin... it startles you... you&apos;re not sure if they mean you harm or not. One of the larger dolphin keeps circling you, as though it is beaconing to you.</desc>

Your body seems to surf across the blue water with the swift movement of the dolphin towing you.  All of a sudden, the dolphin dives deep and you lose your grip. He surfaces beside you as he leaps out of the water, splashing you playfully as he dives back into the ocean.</desc>
      <desc>   The dolphin swims off to investigate a school of fish, leaving you west of the canoe landing, to swim ashore on your own.</desc>
