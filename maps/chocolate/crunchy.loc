      <desc>John Crunchalot couldn&apos;t help himself and wanted to see the inside of the Bandits ship. It was huge from the outside but inside was small and dark, when he reached the front of the ship he sat down and looked at all the buttons lighting up in front of him. He had never been in the captian&apos;s seat of a shuttle before and looked out the window to see the Crunchies unloading the crates to prepare a feast for John and his pals.. Then he notices something.. A button that just looked out of place from the rest, why not, what could it hurt? John thought to himself and he pressed the button and a door opened in the back of the Bandits shuttle... Going back to see where that door leads he found a gaint tank of sorts. Labeled &apos;CHOCOLATE&apos; He showed his findings to his father and before long the Crunchies were making Chocolate Crunch bars.. The voice stops and you notice you are in a cafe, small, with just a few booths, maybe it would be best just to sit for a minute or two..</desc>

      <desc>With another flip of a switch the magent moved acrossed it&apos;s track and to the hanger opening of the landing pad, Bandits screaming curse words and threats of revenge all the way.. John Crunchalot smiled as he flipped another switch, he and his pals watched the magnet start swinging back and fourth and while it was swinging they all started to giggle, one last flip at just the right time sent the Bandits flying out of the landing pad in far away in space, never to bother the Crunchies again. John Crunchalot and his pals all gave high fives and started jumping for joy, and then there was a clapping, first one, then maybe ten, then more.. All the Crunchies had been watching from the security station above the landing pad, John Crunchalot and his pals were named heros and the Crunchies were never bothered by Bandits again.... But that&apos;s not the end of our story.... Proceed WEST to hear the end of this tale.....</desc>

      <desc>But remembering that the Bandits wore metal suits John Crunchalot and his pals decided to borrow the huge magnet from one of the factories that was currently not in use, and when the Bandits came they would turn it on and stick them to the magnet and then fling them out into space. John Crunchalot and his pals worked hard every chance they got on their magnet and was just finishing up the last details when the planet alarm came on warning everyone that the Bandits were near. John Crunchalot and his pals hid behind some crates and watched at the Bandits ship landed, and a group of Bandits exited their ship. There was not a Crunchie in site, just hundreds of crates on the landing pad for the Bandits to take in hopes they would take them and leave quickly. But John Crunchalot flipped his magic switch and before the Bandits knew what was going on they were being sucked up into the air and onto the magnet.......

      <desc>A voice comes over the loud speaker and starts telling you a story, &apos;Once there was a boy, John Crunchalot, a friendly boy, helpful in every way he could be, loved to learn, well liked by all. He was son to a poor family, both his parents work long hours in the Crunchy factories, and not because the factories didn&apos;t pay well, and not because the cost of living was to high, but because bandits would come every week and rob the planet of it&apos;s main source of food, they would take just about every thing made from the factories that week and leave hundreds of Crunchies wounded, and worse if someone tried to stop them. One day while John Crunchalot was out playing with the other Crunchie Children they started talking about the Bandits and decided to figure out a way to stop the Bandits once and for all! They had to act quickly because the Bandits were due back in just a few days........ Proceed to the WEST for the rest of this tale.......</desc>

      <desc>Looking down you notice the floor has a very unique disign to it, wait, it says something, you look around for something to stand on and see a ladder, climbing to the top of the ladder so that you can read the message you almost fall, but steady yourself and look down, the message says, &quot;Here once stood the great Sir John Crunchalot, Hero, friend and all around nice guy!&quot; You smile and look around to see if there are any exits besides west by the gaurd and you notice the gaurd is coming towards you, &apos;HEY YOU THERE!&apos; You jump down from ladder just as he reaches it and explain your reason for being here, he smiles and motions you to the west</desc>

      <desc>Here is where our planet Crunchy now does peaceful trading with other planets, being robbed by Bandits has made us realize that we can&apos;t be a scared race of beings any more.. We have to stand up for ourselves and welcome new and different people as well. Please keep in mind that we do have help from some outside races to keep our planet running and do not unload tons of goods already being delievered by those factories, Remember the Cafe is to the NE if you need a quick bite to eat and if something comes up and you need to leave in a hurry you may go OUT to the landing pad. Thank you and have a wonderful day!</desc>
