         The form consists of a page full of legal jargon written in very small print. It starts out "The party of the first part..." and you discover that if you try to read any further, your eyes just drift and your mind wanders. At the bottom of the form is a space for your signature.

         You are about to sign the form when the droid grimaces, and says, "now now my dear, you can't get something for nothing, and Mr Shoddy doesn't like people who try to cheat him out of his earnings, so just you come back when you have got the 100 groats to pay for a jump, understand?"

         A small droid stops you from walking out onto the platform. "Oh no, sorry my dear," it says, "but you can't come onto the platform if you aren't insured, oh dear me no, it would be more than my job's worth to allow you." It pushes you back onto the roof garden.

         The fluffy white cloud is just a couple of inches long. There seems to be no substance to the charm, it is just a patch of mist that somehow stays anchored to your inventory.

         You give the cloud a gentle squeeze. The mist starts to swirl and the cloud rises up to hover around your head.

         You release the cloud charm, but it simply billows a little and then reforms in your inventory.

         The doors close and the elevator plummets sickeningly downward, moving all the way from the top of the building to the bottom. For a short while, your feet leave the floor and you seem to float. Before you can panic, the elevator stops suddenly. The doors open to disgorge the passengers, and you emerge on the ground floor.

         As if you were a Miss Universe contestant, you treat the umbrella like a baton and twirl it a few times, then throw it up into the air. It twirls over and over as it goes up. You attempt to catch it on its descent, but miss; it lands on the ground, point first, then bounces up again and hits you on the nose. Cursing, you grab it and get it back under control.

         Like a Miss Universe contestant, %s treats an umbrella like a baton and twirls it a few times, then throws it up into the air. Unfortunately, our contestant failes to catch it on its descent; it lands on the ground, point first, then bounces up again and strikes the twirler on the nose.

         Pretending the umbrella is a rifle, you point it at an imaginary target and make shooting noises. Bang! Ack-ack-ack! Although this is fun, it draws the attention of a health and safety droid, which trundles up and lectures you about how there's a zero tolerance attitude to firearms, even pretend ones, and any further incidents could result in your being sent for psychiatric assessment.

         You hear pretend shooting noises, and see that %s is treating an umbrella like a rifle, pointing it an imaginary targets and going "bang!" and "ack-ack-ack!" This attracts the attention of a health and safety droid who trundles up and gives a lecture about the Galactic Administration's zero tolerance attitude to firearms, even pretend ones.

         You strip off your nano-chameleon suit and hang it on a convenient hook, then step into the shower. The door closes behind you, enclosing you in the egg-shaped pod. The anti-grav kicks in and you float gently into the center of the pod. Jets of cool water shoot out from all directions, hard little needles that hit every part of you like an invigorating massage.

         <para number='2'>
         Then the water heats up slightly, the jets get a little softer, and soap is added to the mix, covering you with a layer of cleansing lather. Invisible hands (some kind of forcefield, maybe?) rub your skin, making sure any dirt is removed and loose particles of all kinds are washed away.
         </para>

         <para number='3'>
         A final rinse from the gushing water gets rid of all the soap, and then the water is replaced by warm air that wafts in all directions, drying you thoroughly and reaching all your little crevices. The pod door opens and you step out and don your clothes again, feeling clean and relaxed, ready to face the Galaxy.

         An elf drapes a thick fur rug over you, and you snuggle into it. He steps back, and the reindeer start to move.

         Santa's grotto vanishes out of sight behind you, as the sleigh zooms along. There's nothing to be seen except a vast expanse of white. Then the noise of the runners changes, and you realize the reindeer are running along the length of a huge glacier. They pound along, their hooves ringing on the ice, and then you can suddenly see that the ice falls away as the glacier ends in a sheer cliff.

         Of course, you should have remembered that Santa's sleigh can fly! The reindeers' legs keep on galloping even though they are flying; perhaps that's how they propel themselves through the air. You look down and see that you are now flying over Earth's wilderness area; you can see the patchwork of different greens, the brown of the swampy area, the blue and white of the various rivers.
         </para>

         <para number='6' comment='Sleighride - message 3'>
         The reindeers turn to the left, and the sleigh tilts over alarmingly as it banks into the turn. You wish it had been fitted with seatbelts! Far below you are the lights of Earth's spaceport; as you watch, you can see a shuttle launching itself from the landing pad to dock with one of the ships waiting in orbit.

         <para number='7' comment='Sleighride - message 4'>
         The reindeers seem to gather themselves, then leap upwards; the sleigh follows the launching shuttle and leaves the planet behind. Somehow, there's a bubble of air surrounding you even though the sleigh seems open to the vacuum of space. Below you is the familiar "blue marble" that is the Earth seen from space, which you have seen so many times on your ship's view screen, but seeing it directly is a very different thing.

         Leaving Earth behind, the reindeer set course for the further reaches of the Solar System. You zoom past Mars and its two tiny moons, take a turn around the giant Jupiter, then approach Saturn where you can take in the view of the magnificent rings.

         The reindeer turn again, and head back towards the sun. A little blue dot starts to get bigger, and bigger, until it fills your view and the sleigh is once again in orbit around the Earth. The deer do a couple of circuits around the planet, taking a lower orbit each time, and then zoom downwards at frightening speed, heading towards the snowy wastes of the north pole.

         The sleigh gets closer and closer to the ground, plummeting at great speed, until you are sure it's going to crash... but suddenly, it touches down, the reindeers' hooves make contact with the snow, and the sleigh slithers to a halt outside Santa's grotto again.

         This is the real sleigh Santa uses to delivery presents on Christmas day. The reindeer are not the famous ones whose names you know; those only do the job on the day, and for now these younger deer are being allowed to pull the sleigh as a training exercise. You peek into the sleigh, and can see an empty turkish delight box under one of the seats.

Amazingly, instead of "walking down the stairs" it starts to walk up the wall - it is an anti-grav slinky. It walks to the top then turns and heads across the ceiling, and back down the opposite wall, finally coming to rest on the floor next to you. You pick it up again.

         The cake actually tastes pretty good; the combination of spices and very dark sugar is pleasing. But it has the solidity of a small boulder. You scrunch your way through, avoiding the bullet-like bits of fruit which are scattered through it and have the density of depleted uranium, and are left with an aching jaw and a solid lump in your belly (or wherever food goes for your particular anatomy).

Two more droids hustle it out the back to be sorted out, giving you a fierce glare as they go.

         A snow globe in the shape of a Christmas tree, but this one has snow perpetually falling onto a typically christmassy scene. A myriad of colours radiate from it lighting the surrounding branches as a holographic skier slaloms down the outside, jumping from branch to branch till he disappears at the bottom and mysteriously reappears at the top of the tree to start his descent once more!
