      <desc>   Beneath you lies the seared and blackened asteroid known as Snark. Your instruments make it clear that it is far from being uninhabited, though!</desc>

      <desc>   The space around you is permeated with a strange greenish-blue glow. Your instruments suggest that you are looking at the residual tachyon radiation caused by the creation of neutron/anti-neutron pairs out of nothingness. </desc>
      <desc>   You are suitably awed by this revelation.</desc>

      <desc>   You find the green-blue glow unsettling, but a flicker of your mass-magnetometer indicates the possibility of something to the east of your present position.</desc>

      <desc>   You feel like you are on the edge of nowhere. Angrily you cut in the filters to remove the flickering light from outside.</desc>

      <desc>   You are flying through Hilbert space by the seat of your pants - none of your instruments are making any sense at all.</desc>

      <desc>   The all pervading greenish-blue light seems to be affecting your sense of direction. You are beginning to be worried about whether you are flying round in circles.</desc>

      <desc>   Space here is curiously striated. You have no idea what it means as bands of green and blue march past your window in weird, unfathomable sequences.</desc>
