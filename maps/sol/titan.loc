      <name>Hut</name>
      <desc>   The most important piece of equipment you need can be found here: skis. They are piled up in untidy heaps, but luckily somebody has taken care that the pairs are stored together, otherwise you could easily end up with mismatched skis. Just help yourself.</desc>
      <desc>   The door out of the hut is west.</desc>

      <name>Foot of mountain</name>
      <desc>   The mist clears a little for a moment, allowing you to see the mountain clearly. It towers above you, and the markers showing the positions of the ski runs dwindle away in the distance until they are simply tiny dots moving up the mountain side.</desc>
      <desc>   The path that leads away from the mountain is to the northwest.</desc>
      <desc>   There is a chairlift here, allowing you to ascend the mountain.</desc>

      <name>Top of mountain</name>
      <desc>   Pause for a moment and take in the view... from the top of the mountain you can look down, down, through the swirling mist to the hopper field below, where the small crafts show up as tiny smudges against the ice.</desc>
      <desc>   Now look outwards, and you can see the rings of Saturn stretching across the sky, seeming to be solid bands of color even though they are made up of separate rocks.</desc>
      <desc>   From here, the only way to descend the mountain is to ski down one of the slopes, which lie to the north.</desc>
