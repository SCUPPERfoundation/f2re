      <desc>   The President of the Magellan Society makes himself available to anyone who cares to come calling, and delights in meeting people from all walks of life. Now too old to go out exploring new worlds himself, he sits back and lets the Galaxy come to him. His official burdens are not onerous, leaving him plenty of time to greet and entertain those who visit the Society. Although his knowledge is vast, his insatiable curiosity means he spends little time talking, instead preferring to listen to the tales visitors bring to him. The first port of call for any society member who returns from an expedition is the President&apos;s office, and before any official report is turned in, the President wants to hear the story in great detail.</desc>

      <desc>   Universal Exports is an old, long-established company that moves goods backwards and forwards, buying low and selling high. The firm does what merchants do, but as a corporate entity rather than as independent traders. This means they can make a lot more money than individual traders, although they can be slower to recognize and exploit new and emerging trends. They don&apos;t operate on Earth, to avoid interference from the Guild - who would like to think they have a monopoly on such activities - but instead have their headquarters here on the Magellan space station.</desc>
      <desc>   This vast room serves as the lobby, and has been decorated in a modern style (unlike the old-fashioned look of the Guild building on Earth) with the curving walls and ceiling and the lack of corners and edges that are so popular today and which give the impression of being inside a giant egg.</desc>

The hot story on the grapevine is that they are the brokers for a highly illicit process to increase stamina. Should you be looking for something along those lines, you should talk to Blythe.</desc>

      <name>Quay D&apos;Orsay Souvenirs</name>
      <desc>   Visitors to Magellan are discouraged from leaving without some memento to remind them of their stay, and this shop has a wide selection in reasonably good taste. There&apos;s the usual range of mugs, t-shirts, pens and comm bracelets adorned with pictures of the station, as well as posters showing the station rotating in the starry sky, with Earth in the background.</desc>
      <desc>   The most popular item is a miniature model of the Magellan space station, which rotates on its stand, powered by a tiny fuel cell. Holographic representations of the sailing ship that appears on the Magellan Society crest - which you should have noticed as you approached the station - are also selling well.</desc>
      <desc>   The name of the shop has no significance; clearly somebody just plucked a French street name off a map because it fit with the theme!</desc>
      <desc>   The shop is completely automated; should you leave via the east exit, a scanner will detect the goods you are carrying and deduct the groats from your bank account.</desc>

      <name>Burlesque corridor</name>
      <desc>   This wide, spacious corridor, which stretches south as far as you can see, is filled with people here for pleasure rather than business. As well as those spending holiday time on Magellan, there are visitors who fly up from Earth to see a show or have a meal in exotic surroundings. None of the people in the crowd are moving with any sense of urgency; they amble along, veering from side to side, stopping to look at anything which takes their fancy. There is a general air of relaxed enjoyment.</desc>
      <desc>   North, the corridor leads back to the shuttle docking bay, while on the west side of the corridor is a shop selling souvenirs. To the east is a cafe, with a cluster of tables and chairs outside the door, on which visitors are taking refreshment. There are large gaily-striped umbrellas over each table, which seems absurd given there is no weather on the space station, but it does fit the French theme.</desc>

      <name>Cafe Blanc</name>
      <desc>   The decor in the Cafe Blanc is a rather sanitized version of an ancient Parisian cafe, more in line with tourists&apos; expectations than with reality. The walls are covered with posters; some of them of art by French painters such as Toulouse-Lautrec, and others showing famous Parisian land-marks, such as the ancient iron tower called Eiffel, which was demolished by a terrorist bomb before the space-going era.</desc>
      <desc>   The waitdroids in the cafe are painted black, and are wearing long white aprons. A few of them even have droopy mustaches affixed to their metallic faces. They move in a very leisurely fashion, in no hurry to serve the customers in the bar or at the tables outside.</desc>
      <desc>   The special drink of the house is absinthe, an incredibly strong aniseed-flavored liqueur with a reputation for making those who drink too much go blind; of course, the version you can buy here has been altered to remove those dangerous properties.</desc>

      <name>Brasserie Camile Saint Saens</name>
      <desc>   This restaurant, which enjoys the highest reputation amongst gourmets throughout the Solar System, has been named after one of the most famous French composers, and one of his symphonies is being played softly over the speaker system. On the walls are pictures of various animals, in homage to his Le Carnaval des Animaux (Carnival of the Animals).</desc>
      <desc>   But never mind the decor, what people come here for is the food - the best French cuisine anywhere outside Paris itself. Rich, thick aromas come from the kitchen and from the plates of food being consumed by elegantly-costumed diners. The &quot;specialite de la maison&quot; is steak frite, a steak with French fries accompanied by a pepper sauce and a small green salad. This may sound quite plain but with the best quality ingredients, and the attention to detail the genuine French chef gives to his work, it truly is a meal fit for an Emperor, particularly when washed down with a glass of the fine red wine from the cellar.</desc>

The gentle music ripples along the corridor, bringing a smile to the faces of the tourists passing by. He is obviously a hit with the crowd, because the beret he has placed on the ground in front of him is full of coins and even a few notes.</desc>

      <name>Le Club Chaud</name>
      <desc>   The name means The Hot Club, which was intended to imply that the club is the in place to go, at the height of modality. It could also apply to the ambient temperature; the crowds are packed tight in here and it&apos;s very hot. Tables and chairs are crammed in so as many people as possible can see the stage on which dancers are performing the cancan - a lively dance in which they kick their legs high into the air, showing their underwear. When it was invented, this dance was the height of naughtiness and was banned, but today it just seems jolly good fun!</desc>
      <desc>   Waitdroids bustle around, ensuring that every table has a carafe of cheap red wine on it. The patrons guzzle the wine with gusto as they cheer on the antics of the high-kicking dancers. Many of the patrons have dressed in traditional old Parisian dress for the occasion, which adds to their enjoyment.</desc>

Those on holiday often lose all inhibitions under the influence of the relaxed, slightly sensual atmosphere and are less up-tight about talking to complete strangers. Many a lasting friendship has been formed through a chance encounter in the burlesque corridor.</desc>
      <desc>   There is a costumiers to the east called Valentino; the door is flanked by two mannequins wearing clothes suitable to the period evoked by the theme of the burlesque corridor.</desc>

Valentino rents out costumes for those who don&apos;t have nano-chameleon suits, and have to rely on old-fashioned cloth.

      <desc>   A portly tenor stands in the center of the corridor, regaling the passers-by with famous songs from ancient operas. He manages occasionally to slip in something French by Berlioz or St Saens, but the crowd prefers the tunes they are familiar with by such composers as Puccini, Verdi and the insectoid alien composer Buxella Kkinini. He has collected quite a crowd around him who are enjoying his singing, and a great cheer goes up every time he starts a new tune that they recognize.</desc>

      <desc>   The efforts to disguise the fact that the space station corridors are just great big metal tubes are greatest here in the garden, which is very aptly named - it really does feel something like paradise. Tall trees hide any trace of the metal walls or ceiling, and bright lights which illuminate and provide the solar energy needed by the trees and plants make it feel as if you were in a real Earth garden or wood. But there is something missing; there&apos;s no birdsong and no rustling of animals in the undergrowth.</desc>
      <desc>   A path which has been covered with soft green grass (a product of the labs on Phobos) meanders through the trees, leading south, southwest and west. Along the sides of the paths are bushes and shrubs, some of them in flower with blooms in a riot of colors.</desc>

      <desc>   Everything about the decor of the hotel reception area screams of wealth, in the most ostentatious fashion possible - there&apos;s nothing understated here. A commissionaire stands by the door to aid guests as they enter and leave the hotel, porters stand ready to help with luggage, and the hotel manager walks through the reception from time to time, just checking that everything is running smoothly.

Close inspection shows that the water comes from a duct in one wall and runs out through another, but both are carefully disguised with undergrowth. The water is clear, and as it runs through its channel it makes a chuckling sound. It is deep enough to allow swimming, although it is very cold so only a few people are taking advantage of this. Others are sitting on the bank dangling various limbs into the water.</desc>
