      <name>Sensor array</name>
      <desc>   You are in the middle of a flat area containing a sensor array. Most of the rigs are familiar, but one or two of the antennas look a little strange.  </desc>
      <desc>   A north/south path runs through the area connecting the landing pad in the south to the main pathway in the north. To the east is the business end of a large particle cannon.</desc>

      <name>Particle cannon</name>
      <desc>   The muzzle of a very large particle cannon pokes out of the ground. Massive deflector coils circle it, gleaming nightmarishly in the strange light from overhead. </desc>
      <desc>   The surrounding area is very broken, but it is possible to move west, where there is an impressive array of sensors, and northwest.</desc>

      <name>Small spoil heap</name>
      <desc>   You are perched on the top of a small spoil heap, from which you can look out over a bleak landscape. The only safe way off the heap is by going north.</desc>

      <name>Silos</name>
      <desc>   You are in an area dotted with missile silos. Not the place to be caught in when they are being launched! An energy curtain runs from the east round to the south.  </desc>
      <desc>   West is an unclimbable jumble of boulders.</desc>

      <name>Landing pad</name>
      <desc>   This is the asteroid's landing area. It looks inhospitable and bleak. To the north is the start of a path leading towards a blockhouse, low down on the asteroid's shockingly near horizon.</desc>
