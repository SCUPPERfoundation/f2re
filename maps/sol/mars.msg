         %s walks in the wrong direction and stumbles against one of the walls. The lines and whorls suddenly flare up, dazzling you for a moment, and when the glare reduces and you can see again, there is a new dead, dry image added to the collection in the room...

         With no warning, part of the ledge crumbles beneath you. Desperately you clutch at the rock face, but there are no hand holds at this point. The fall to the bottom of the pit only takes a handful of seconds, but to you the time seems like an eternity...

         You grab one of the ice cream baskets and start to lick at the frozen delicacy. It is... actually, you have no idea what it is, but it is revolting! It's black and has a greasy taste to it, like a cross between lub oils and spaceship fuel. Perhaps it was intended for consumption by the waitdroids?

         You hear a crackling sound, and the sky is suddenly lit up with green flashes. Forks of emerald lightning arc across the sky, as if the universe was about to split apart. Could it be the end of the universe as we know it?
         </para>

         <para number='3'>
         The lightning flashes come faster and faster, and the forks get closer and closer together, until the whole sky shines with a continuous green light. The illumination pulses slightly, getting brighter then dimmer again, brigher... dimmer... it's almost hypnotic.
         </para>

         <para number='4'>
         Around you, people gasp and murmer in wonder, not sure whether to be afraid or to just enjoy the amazing light show.
         </para>

         <para number='5' comment='Scene 2`'>
         A small black dot appears almost directly overhead. It looks as though the green light is a solid dome, and the black dot a tiny hole in it. The hole widens slightly, and you realize that whatever the black dot is, it is getting larger.
         </para>

         <para number='6'>
         It suddenly becomes apparent what you are seeing, as your brain processes the visual information and translates the optical illusion into reality: it is an object that is getting closer, falling down towards Mars city. The crackling sound has stopped now, but a very faint noise replaces it - the sound of something screaming towards the planet.
         </para>

         <para number='7' comment='Scene 3'>
         The noise gets louder and resolves into something familiar - it's an engine. Someone in the crowd gasps and says, "It's a spaceship!" Of course it is, and it's coming in to land at very high speed. But it's no type you have ever seen before. Triangular in shape, it's completely black, with no markings at all.
         </para>

         <para number='8'>
         It falls further towards the city, and you expect it to start to veer off towards the spaceport, but it doesn't - it still seems to be heading straight for you. Surely that is just an illusion?
         </para>

         <para number='9' comment='Scene 4'>
         The strange black ship continues to hurtle downwards, and it looks as if it really is going to land right here on the roof. It is getting very close now, so that it practically fills your field of vision, blotting out the sky so you cannot see if the green lights are still flashing or not.
         </para>

         <para number='10'>
         With a whine of motors and rush of wind, the unknown vessel suddenly comes to a dead stop in the air above your head. It hovers about twenty feet off the ground, directly over the Chez Diesel building. You wait, along with everyone else on the roof, to see what happens next.
         </para>

         <para number='11' comment='Scene 5'>
         What happens next is that with a rumbling noise, a crack appears in the bottom of the ship, from which spills that familiar green light. The gap widens and a long, thin object protrudes. You can hear a hooting noise from within the ship - then suddenly, the object spouts a beam of light which connects with one of the waitdroids and blows its head clean off!
         </para>

         <para number='12'>
         Someone in the crowd suddenly exclaims, "Oh my god - I know what that is. It's a Martian heat ray. I remember seeing it in Horsell, many years ago. It's the Martians - they've come back!" Screams and sounds of panicgreet this announcement.
         </para>

         <para number='13' comment='Scene 6'>
         The heat ray spits again, and another waitdroid's head is vaporized, then another. The few remaining shove you, along with the other party-goers, to one edge of the roof, shielded between the bouncy castle and some huge exotic pot plants. Good, faithful droids, they are trying to protect Diesel's customers from harm, as they have been programmed to do.
         </para>

         <para number='14' comment='Scene 7'>
         The heat ray fires once more, but this time it doesn't hit anyone - or anything. Then there is a sizzling noise, and sparks come from the end of the mechanism, and it drops off and lands with a "clang" on the roof. It seems to have malfunctioned rather badly!
         </para>

         <para number='15'>
         There is a sudden hooted exclamation from inside the ship - it sounds like the Martian equivalent of "Oh bugger!"
         </para>

         <para number='16' comment='Scene 8'>
         After a moment, more hooting can be heard from within the ship, along with some hammering noises. They stop, then start up again, until the hammering is quite frenzied. The hooting begins to sound desperate, but then you hear some motors start to work, and the hooting takes on a triumphant tone. A ramp protrudes from the opening underneath the ship, and reaches down towards the roof.
         </para>

         <para number='17'>
         About half way there, it judders to a halt. There is more hammering and hooting, and the ramp moves a bit more then stops, moves and then stops, then with a horrendous graunching noise it finally completes its extension and touches the roof.
         </para>

         <para number='18' comment='Scene 9'>
         A figure appears at the top of the ramp. For a moment, you can't make out what it looks like - it's just a silhouette against the green light. Then someone in the crowd exclaims, "It's a Martian!" No real surprise, given that someone had already identified the heat ray, but it is still a shock to see our old enemy return.
         </para>

         <para number='19' comment='Scene 10'>
         The Martian starts to move down the ramp, and another follows it. Now you can make out the details. What you are seeing is not the actual Martians themselves, but two of their three-legged fighting machines.
         </para>

         <para number='20'>
         Except... all the old stories you have read talk about the fighting machines being enormous, but these are barely four-foot tall. Could the machines contain dwarf Martians? Or perhaps immature ones, youngsters?
         </para>

         <para number='21' comment='Scene 11'>
         The two Martian machines reach the foot of the ramp and step onto the roof. Their movements seem slightly uncertain, as if the machines are not very good at walking on their three legs. The sensors at the top of the machines swivel back and forth, taking in their surroundings.
         </para>

         <para number='22' comment='Scene 12'>
         Some peremptory hooting comes from within one of the machines. You don't understand the language, so you have no idea what the creature is saying, but it sounds like a demand. Probably not "Take me to your leader!"
         </para>

         <para number='23'>
         Hardly anybody speaks Martian these days, but with an amazing stroke of luck, the waitdroid wearing the jesters cap - the one serving the fizzy drinks - pipes up and says, "I did a correspondence course on alien languages, so I can speak a bit of Martian. I can try to understand what it is saying."
         </para>

         <para number='24' comment='Scene 13'>
         The Martians hoots some more, the waitdroid listens carefully, then attempts to translate. "Where is the artichoke. No, that can't be right..." It listens some more and tries again. "Where is the... weasel? No... oh, I get it, the temple. It is asking where the temple is. It's calling us puny earthlings - goodness, should I be insulted by that? I am not puny, and I have never set foot on Earth."
         </para>

         <para number='25' comment='Scene 14'>
         There is some more hooting, and the droid says, "This is very odd. It seems to think it has landed in the middle of the ruins, and it is demanding to know why we have built Chez Diesel in the religious center of its ancient home."
         </para>

         <para number='26' comment='Scene 15'>
         The waitdroid clears its throat and attempts to hoot back to the Martians in their language. After a few attempts, it seems to make itself understood, and a halting conversation ensues. Suddenly, the waitdroid laughs so hard it almost chokes, and has to take a drink of fizzy soda to recover. "Mmmm, cherry," it says. "My favorite." This does seem somewhat irrelevant considering the danger!
         </para>

         <para number='27' comment='Scene 16'>
         "Oh, this is too funny," the droid exclaims. "It was aiming for the ruins, but obviously its guidance systems malfunctioned. Apparently, the Martians have been stuck out on the galactic rim for so long with so few resources that everything is starting to break down. These guys volunteered for a mission to sneak back to the ruins and see if there was any usable equipment they could salvage."
         </para>

         <para number='28' comment='Scene 17'>
         The hooting from inside the Martian fighting machines becomes strident, and the waitdroid turns back to listen carefully, then translates. "I don't think they like to be laughed at. No sense of humor, apparently. They picked the wrong day to land here, then!" He jingles the bells on his jesters cap to emphasise that today is not a day to be serious.
         </para>

         <para number='29' comment='Scene 18'>
         The droid hoots at the Martians and they hoot at him. It looks puzzled, then explains, "I asked them why they shot up the other waitdroids, before their heat ray went on the fritz. They didn't understand my question - they think us waitdroids are battlebots." The droid looks faintly insulted at the misidentification.
         </para>

         <para number='30'>
         "They planned to dispose of us using the heat ray from within the safety of their ship, then come out and deal with you organic types, who they don't rate as so much of a threat. It's probably just as well their weapon broke down, or we would all be toast by now."
         </para>

         <para number='31' comment='Scene 19'>
         There is some more hooting back and forth. "Oh dear," says the droid. "They are getting impatient. They want us to produce their stolen... heritage? heirlooms? I'm not sure what that word means. Relics, perhaps... They are talking about something called a vandier, and something else called a sargeur. I don't know what those things are."

         Suddenly, the Martians seem to lose patience, and one of the fighting machines strides across the roof and knocks the translating waitdroid to the ground. The other marches towards the trapdoor, obviously intending to descend into the bar. You hope Diesel is ready with her baseball bat!

         <para number='34' comment='Scene 21'>
         At this point, the Martians notice the party-goers cowering between the bouncy castle and the plants, and after conferring with each other in a muted hooting, they change direction and advance towards you and the others menacingly. The sensors on the top of the first Martian fighting machine zoom in on your position, and the alien gets closer and closer to you...

         Suddenly, one of the tripod's legs steps onto a container of ice cream that was dropped by Jen - or possibly Berry - when their heads exploded. The fighting machine lurches as the foot slips sideways, and drops of the ice cream splatter in all directions. Some lands on you; you lick it off - mmmm, chocolate heaven, almost enough to take your mind off your impending death!

         The Martian falls and knocks into its colleague, who also topples, and the two fighting machines accidentally stumble onto the bouncy castle. They bounce... bounce... bounce... getting more wildly uncoordinated with each ascension, and then suddenly they caroom off each other, off the side walls, off the bouncy castle and towards the edge of the roof.
         </para>

         <para number='37' comment='Scene 24'>
         Just as the fighting machines are about to be catapulted right over the edge of the force field, they crack open and the actual Martians tumble out and land in a heap on the table which holds the fizzy soda. The aliens look something like octopuses; slimy blobs with a lot of unpleasant tentacles. They write around on the table, attempting to get their tentacles pointing downwards so they can control their movements.

         The table collapses and the aliens roll off, hooting in distress. The brightly-colored beverages start to spill from their containers and drip onto the Martians.

         They don't seem too disturbed by the cherry flavor or the lemon; the tangerine and the peppermint have no effect, apart from making the slimy aliens look like an explosion in a paint factory, not to mention getting them all sticky; but then a container of Diesel's Old Peculiar splits open and disgorges its contents all over the creatures, and some of it drips into what passes for their mouths. They swallow it down...
         </para>

         <para number='40' comment='Scene 26'>
         The aliens go rigid for a moment, their tentacles sticking out stiffly in all directions. With a high-pitched hoot of distress, they collapse, completely limp, either dead or unconscious. Well, you always knew Diesel's Old Peculiar was potent stuff, but usually it takes more than a few drops to make drinkers pass out!

         As you wonder whether it's safe to come out, you hear the chunter of engines, and looking over the side of the roof you see several Imperial Navy stinger-ships zooming down from the sky. They take up station around the Martian ship, which is still hovering above the roof garden.

         A squad of Imperial Marines in full combat gear jumps from the ships' hatches and lands on the roof. The troops swiftly gather up the bodies of the Martians and the collapsed fighting machines and jump back up to the ships. Then a special naval cleaning droid is lowered down to the roof; it hoovers up the spilt ice cream and puddles of fizzy soda, and generally cleans up the mess, leaving the roof garden tidier than it has been for years!

         A Marine mechanic activates replacements for the blown up waitdroids, including the two ice cream droids. Jen and Berry Mk II bustle around calling for replacement ice cream and drinks to be sent up from the kitchen. The droid who had been acting as a translator picks itself up from the corner into which it had been flung, repositions its jesters cap on its head, and prepares to serve fizzy soda again.
         </para>

         <para number='44' comment='Scene 30'>
         Finally, the Marine that seems to be in charge salutes you and the others left on the roof. "Right, that's all sorted," he says in a brisk voice. "Now it would be a very good idea if you just forgot that anything happened here. In fact, I would caution you against ever mentioning these events to anyone at all, and especially not to the press, not if you know what's good for you."

         After issuing this ominous but cryptic threat, he jumps back up to his stinger-ship. The navy ships take the Martian vessel in tow, and fly off with it, leaving everything the way it was again. You can go back to the fun of the party and forget about your alien encounter. It's all over.

         The strands slowly change color, from silver to gold. Then to orange. Then red, violet, blue and green. The changes become faster until the tinsel is putting on a dazzling light show, that should be accompanied by psychedelic music. After mesmerising you for a while, the colors fade back to silver and the tinsel resumes its usual size.

         She laughs a big, booming laugh which makes the glasses on the tables rattle. "Oh come on," she says, "everyone's heard of me. I'm the most famous bar-owner ever. I've been running this bar since the early days of the colony on Mars.

         "Chez Diesel is my pride and joy," Diesel says, with a misty look in her eyes.

         "I had to replace the furniture every couple of weeks, because the drinkers were always hitting each other over the head with chairs and tables when they started to fight, but that was just part of the cost of doing business.

         </para>

         <para number='7'>
         "Then Mars became the booming settlement it is today," Diesel continues, "the colony expanded, and my clientele changed - we really went upmarket. I had to redecorate the place, installed the fountain, hired a pianist and so on. I make a helluva lot more money now, but sometimes I miss the fun of those early, hell-raising days." She sighs nostalgically and places the bat back on the bar.

         "I wasn't quite one of the founding fathers," she says - then pauses to think for a moment. "Do I mean founding mothers? No, that sounds terrible - like a female overlord being an overlady.

         She shakes herself out of her reverie. "Where was I? Oh yes, the founding of Mars. I wasn't in the first wave of colonists, but once the colony was established enough to need somewhere people could relax and have a drink, I saw the opportunity and set up the bar here.

         Diesel frowns. "I know the archeologists were hoping they would find Martians still living somewhere deep in the ruins, but thank Pegasus they turned out to be long gone. Still, I remember the problems they caused in the past, trying to get back through to this time, or this dimension, or whatever the official term is. They were a real menace. And of course their meddling with time finally brought interstellar commerce crashing down.

         "There are some people who blame every little thing that happens on the Martians. Oh, I tripped over the cat - it's the Martians' fault. My spaceship broke down - must be the Martians' fault. Idiots." She looks scornful.

         "At the other extreme, of course, are those fools in the Alien Protection League, who deny that the Martians ever tried to invade Earth. They think the Martians are cuddly benign creatures who have been misunderstood. Morons!"

         "Don't get me wrong," explains Diesel, "I believe aliens are people too and deserve just the same rights as humans. I've always welcomed them in the bar, so long as they have groats. But I don't go along with those woolly-minded bleeding hearts who seem to think aliens are some kind of saints who can do no wrong.

         Balancing the plate in one hand and trying to cut the meat with the inadequate cutlery in the other isn't easy, but the steak is so tender you almost don't need the knife at all! You wolf the whole lot down, savoring every bite of the delicious meal.

         The waitdroid ties a large paper bib around your neck, and then offers you a rack of ribs. You tear the meat off the bone with your teeth, smothering yourself in the sauce as you do so. When you have finished, the waitdroid disposes of the remaining bones, removes the bib and wipes your face clean.

The trail vanishes, and for a moment nothing happens - you wonder if it was a dud.

         At the last minute, a waitdroid spots the looming firework and flings itself into its path, intercepting it before it can strike its target. It flings itself onto the ground on top of the wayward rocket, shielding you - and anyone else who happens to be on the roof - from the resulting explosion. It stands up, showing a huge dent in its body-casing, and staggers off to get repaired.

         The firework hisses, and then shoots jets of sparks high into the air.

         <para number='2' comment='examine mirror II'>
         The frame is matte black, with dull red lines and whorls similar to those on the walls. These, however, do not shine with their own light, they are merely visible in the reflected light from the walls. You trace one of the lines with the tip of a finger (or the equivalent), and feel a tingling sensation.

         <para number='3' comment='examine mirror III'>
         Walking round the mirror you discover that it seems to have no depth and that the back is completely matte black, but solid to the touch. You push hard, but are unable to move it in the slightest.

         <para number='4' comment='examine mirror IV'>
         Returning to the front, you place your hand on the mirror surface. It seems warm and yielding to the touch. Ripples spread out from the point of contact, are reflected from the sides and interfere to produce weird, undulating patterns on the surface.

         Feeling slightly queasy, you step back a few paces, pick up a stone and cast it at the mirror. As it hits the mirror it is absorbed without a trace, not even a ripple, and the surface returns to its original smooth neutral color.

         You push against the elastic texture of the mirror's surface. The resistance suddenly vanishes and you tumble into a void. Gradually you become aware of a dim greenish glow which draws your attention to the fact that you seem to be surrounded by a semi-translucent energy field...

         <para number='9' comment='enter (1st time) III'>
         Suddenly the bubble is shaken violently, as though something has seized it. There is a feeling of rapid acceleration, followed by equally violent deceleration. The energy field collapses in a shower of colored sparks and you find yourself perched on a block of shimmering silver material.

         You order up a plate of the free Thanksgiving food which Diesel has provided: slices of turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce, mashed potato, corn, carrots and green beans - and everything drenched in brown meaty gravy. It's an enormous amount of food, but somehow, you manage to eat it all up without feeling too stuffed.

The waitdroid pours brandy over it and then ignites it; it burns with a blue flame for a few moments, and then you tuck in and finish it all up.

         The cake actually tastes pretty good; the combination of spices and very dark sugar is pleasing. But it has the solidity of a small boulder. You scrunch your way through, avoiding the bullet-like bits of fruit which are scattered through it and have the density of depleted uranium, and are left with an aching jaw and a solid lump in your belly (or wherever food goes for your particular anatomy).

         As you bite into it, you find something even solider than the cake itself. You spit it out and clean off the crumbs - it is a gold coin! It must be quite old because it has a picture of the ex-Emperor Ming on one side. The reserve shows the rear end of a grizzle as it vanishes into a cave. The coin isn't worth anything - it's no longer legal tender - but it's a nice souvenir.
