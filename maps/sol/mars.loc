      <desc>   Some kind of fake snow covers the floor; it crunches when you walk on it. It has drifted around the edges of the roof, merging with the forcefield that stops those imbued with the Christmas spirit from tumbling off the edge.

A large inflatable snowman sits in one corner, rocking backwards and forwards and giggling manically. It&apos;s actually quite scary!</desc>
      <desc>   Phil, the ancient Arcturian piano player, is reluctantly playing a selection of ancient traditional Christmas songs, but from the way he is scowling - and the sign on the piano that says &quot;No I won&apos;t play bloody Jingle Bells!&quot; - he isn&apos;t exactly full of the joys of Christmas.</desc>
