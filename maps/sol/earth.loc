      <name>Path to Santa&apos;s grotto</name>
      <desc>   Snow lies thickly on the ground, and in places it has drifted into piles that look like snow dunes. Thin swirls of mist waft through the air, briefly obscuring your vision and then clearing again. Prickly green and brown fir trees stand starkly against the gleaming white. Some of their branches are coated with ice, and icicles hang down, flashing like diamonds in the bright but cold sunlight.</desc>
      <desc>   On one side of the path is a phalanx of tap-dancing penguins, shuffling and swaying in unison to the strains of big band music. On the other side are several polar bears, standing in stately poses on large blocks of ice that look like mints. The penguins and polar bears are ignoring each other; they probably don&apos;t believe the other really exists!</desc>
      <desc>   Santa&apos;s Grotto lies to the east. There is a portal to the southeast, that will lead you back to the spaceport.</desc>

      <name>Outside Santa&apos;s grotto</name>
      <desc>   Santa&apos;s Grotto is housed in a building constructed entirely from ice; a miniature palace of frozen water, complete with gleaming spires that look like upside-down icicles. A large archway leads into the grotto; two security elves flank the doorway, scrutinizing everybody who enters - they don&apos;t want to take any chances with Santa&apos;s safety, not after the dreadful business from a few years ago.</desc>
      <desc>   All around the grotto are dotted some fantastic ice sculptures. There&apos;s a spaceship, a giant marsrat, a bust of Bella, and a fierce Zlitherworm with its mouth gaping wide.</desc>
      <desc>   Santa&apos;s sleigh is parked outside the grotto, with a team of reindeer hitched up ready to go. A sign advertises free sleigh rides; if you&apos;d like to take one, &quot;enter sleigh&quot;.</desc>
      <desc>   You can go east into the grotto, or west to head back to the spaceport.</desc>

      <name>Santa&apos;s grotto</name>
      <desc>   There is no visible source of light inside the ice palace but somehow the place is brightly illuminated. The  frozen walls reflect the elusive light in flashing, shimmering patterns. Icicles hang from the ceilings, some of them so long they touch the ground, forming ice pillars throughout the room.</desc>
      <desc>   The grotto has been constructed around a living fir tree - this hasn&apos;t been dug up and transplanted, it&apos;s where it has always grown. Silver tinsel twines around the green branches, and tiny white lights twinkle on and off randomly.</desc>
      <desc>   In front of the tree is Santa&apos;s magnificent ice throne, which actually looks very chilly and uncomfortable - but maybe his robes protect his posterior from the perishing cold! Next to the throne is the sack from which he gets candy canes for the good children and lumps of coal for the naughty ones.</desc>
      <desc>   Santa&apos;s security elves are stationed in various strategic places throughout the grotto, keeping a very close eye on all visitors.</desc>

Russian symbols on some of the remains are testament to the fact that the now defunct USSR was the first to attempt to reach the red planet.</desc>

      <desc>   Such heavenly aromas! This popular restaurant serves authentic hunan and szechuan cooking, and is popular with locals and visitors alike - many traders try to time their runs so they have a spare hour or two around lunchtime to eat here.</desc>
      <desc>   The ceiling is hung with Chinese lanterns, which have to be replaced frequently since the paper has a tendency to ignite spontaneously in the intense heat in the restaurant. The diners consider that part of the entertainment, and cheer loudly when a flaming lantern drops onto a table.</desc>
      <desc>   The chef works in the center of the room, chopping, dicing and stir-frying at top speed - it&apos;s better than a cabaret. He works in a heat-resistant suit, to protect himself from the heat source that makes the wok sizzle - the direct heat of the nearby sun, focused onto a hot plate.</desc>

Even the trees that are still standing show some signs of damage such as scorch marks.</desc>

      <name>Dead end</name>
      <desc>   Whether this is a room which is not used for anything, or a tunnel which comes to an abrupt dead end, there&apos;s nothing of interest here, and no way to proceed any further; you will have to turn around and go back to the pillar room to the east.</desc>

      <name>Pillar room</name>
      <desc>   This small room is roughly round in shape, but the walls have been left somewhat rough and uneven. There is less space in the room than its dimensions would suggest, because there is a large metal pillar in the center of the room, which stretches up to - and through - the ceiling, as well as disappearing into the floor below. There is no indication of what the function of the pillar might be.</desc>
      <desc>   The metal tracks curve around the sides of the room, avoiding the pillar, and go north into a tunnel and east into a larger room. West is a small opening, and south a large and very solid door.</desc>

      <name>Circular room</name>
      <desc>   Unlike the surrounding tunnels, the walls of this round space have been smoothed and polished until the bare rock almost shines. The ceiling is rounded, too, so that the room is almost a perfect sphere, except that the floor has been flattened to allow whatever runs on the metal rails to remain level. There is not one scrap of decoration, but the natural colors of the rocks shine in different colors and look rather splendid.</desc>
      <desc>   The room has three exits, all of them circular holes in the wall, with no doors blocking the way. Northeast is a tunnel, southeast a large room of some kind, and west a smaller room.</desc>

      <name>Power room</name>
      <desc>   The room is stuffed full of machinery which looks as if it&apos;s designed to provide power for this underground installation. It&apos;s hot and steamy in here, and the floors and walls all vibrate with the loud noises made by the various mechanical items. Much of the equipment is strange and alien in design, and you are sure it&apos;s of some importance. You examine it in as much detail as you can, in order to make a full report when you get back.</desc>
      <desc>   The door leading out of the room is north; it is closed, but from this side it can be opened easily using the knob in the middle.</desc>

      <name>Room of teeth</name>
      <desc>   This room is vast, and the walls look much more natural than those of the tunnels you have been moving through. It&apos;s likely that this is a natural cavern which the artificial tunnels have linked to.</desc>
      <desc>   Stalactites/stalagmites hang down/jut upwards, and form a barrier that prevents you from moving further into the enormous cavern. They look like the teeth of a snarling giant.</desc>
      <desc>   The only way you can go is northwest.</desc>
