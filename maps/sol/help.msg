         The keyrings that some players carry are both a fashion statement, and a useful item. As well as carrying keys (they come with the key to the executive washroom) you can hang charms or accessories onto them. The keyring is available from the high-class store Gallagher's on Earth, for one slithy tove. New charms go on sale each month for a limited period; they also cost one slithy.

         Some game front-ends allow you to send ANSI codes along with the text, which let you specify what color the text will display in. Normally, the game strips out the ANSI codes, otherwise anybody not using a front-end which supports them would see strange characters along with the text. However, you can stop the game stripping out ANSI codes so that if your front-end knows what to do with them, you can see other players' messages in color.

         Merchants who have proved themselves can purchase warehouses to store goods in so they are not stolen from their ships at reset. See http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/guide/trading/ware.html for the requirements. Once you have a permit, go to an exchange and 'BUY WARE'.
         </para>

         <para number='2'>
         'STORE cargoname' moves the named cargo from your ship into the warehouse. 'DI WARE planetname' lists the contents of the warehouse, and 'FETCH #' moves the contents of the specified bay into your ship. 'SHUFFLE' moves all the goods to the lowest-numbered bays. Dispose of a warehouse with 'SELL WARE'. Traders can also sell warehouses, but not buy them. 'DI WARE' (without specifying a planet) lists all of your warehouses.
         </para>

         <para number='3'>
         Industrialists and Manufacturers can buy depots to aid in running their factories. The commands work the same as for warehouses: 'BUY DEPOT', 'DI DEPOT planetname' or 'DI DEPOT', and storing, fetching and shuffling are the same. See http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/guide/business/depot.html for more info about depots.

         Your Fed II character has four statistics: strength, stamina, dexterity and intelligence. Type 'SCORE' or 'SC' to see the details. Each stat shows a current value and a maximum value. The current can never exceed the maximum.

         <para number='3'>
         Strength - determines how many items you can carry, which isn't all that vital at the moment

         </para>

         <para number='5'>
         Dexterity - determines how good you are at manipulating things, not very important at the moment

         You can buy extra stat points at a cost of 1 slithy tove per point - each stat can be increased to 150. You are limited to one stat increase per day.

         There are not very many things that will kill you in Fed II, but the careless can blunder into danger if they don't pay attention. However, death need not be the final farewell - if you have life insurance you will be cloned and will wake up in the nearest hospital as good as new. (HELP INSURE gives you more details.) Without life insurance, death will wipe out your Fed character completely so you will have to start again.

         Yes, there's a taxman in Fed DataSpace, and he (it must be a man, don't you think?) is always on the lookout for excess earnings that might be a sign of dodgy dealings and suspicious financial activity.

         Merchants who have proved themselves can purchase warehouses to store goods in so they are not stolen from their ships at reset. See http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/guide/trading/ware.html for the requirements. Once you have a permit, go to an exchange and 'BUY WARE'.
