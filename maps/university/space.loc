      <desc>Welcome to the University campus. Currently, most of the campus is off limits to all but faculty, staff, and current or prospective students. A campus police cruiser, assuming you are a delivery person, signals for you to either dock with the Waterlabs research facility - a small planet consisting entirely of water - or exit the campus through the link.</desc>
