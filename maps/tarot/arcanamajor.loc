      <name>The Tealeaf Tea Room</name>
      <desc>Dark oak beams, white painted plaster and and gingham clothed tables make this a cosy spot to have a cuppa.  The blackboard menu on the wall declares the specials to be &quot;Hare Today, Scone Tomorrow&quot;. The charismatic waiter appears by your table and conjures up a rose chintz china tea-pot and cups while he waits for your order.</desc>
      <desc>     At a corner table, two ecclesiastical figures seem to be involved in a quietly heated debate. He says &quot;tradition&quot; while she counters with &quot;intuition&quot;. Fortunately most of the conversation is too quiet to hear. The door is to the south of the room.</desc>

      <name>A Stony Path</name>
      <desc>An old man in a grey hooded cloak shuffles past you on the path.  He mutters bitterly about tourists rushing here there and everywhere.  He lifts a lantern higher as if to see you more clearly before snorting and continuing on his not so merry way. A sign above the door of a thatched building to the north announces &quot;The Tealeaf Tea Room&quot;. The path bends from the east to the south.</desc>

      <name>The Fool&apos;s Precipice</name>
      <desc>You find yourself standing on the edge of a sheer cliff in bright sunlight. Below you, clouds cover whatever lies at the bottom of the drop. A fresh breeze ripples through the grass at your feet. From somewhere far below comes the sound of a small dog yipping. A cloven-hoofed character approaches you selling tickets to &quot;The Leap of Faith&quot; attraction, extolling it as a true free fall experience without the need for restrictive equipment such as bungee harnesses or parachutes. Apparently all you have to do is pay your money and step off the cliff to the east.</desc>

      <name>You pay the price and step out into thin air...</name>
      <desc>Ah the exhilaration of free falling through air! The wind buffets your body as the cliff face zooms by at an ever increasing speed.  You drop into the clouds and for a moment or two the moist, misty vapor is all you can see. Then suddenly you are through and the ground becomes visible.. a hard, rocky looking ground that is approaching very very fast! Directly beneath you, the rocks appear to be darkly stained. It&apos;s at this point that you remember the ticket seller never mentioned a safe landing being part of the attraction. It looks as though the only way to go is down and you are doing that already. As the ground rockets up to meet you, you catch a glimpse of a skeletal figure on a white horse waiting below.</desc>

      <name>Zenia&apos;s Tree Trunk</name>
      <desc>Inside the tree trunk, the walls are hung with coloured lanterns and draped fabric. An intricately woven rug covers the floor and is soft beneath your feet. The mystic, Zenia, sits upon a pile of cushions behind a very low polished table. Upon the table are twenty-two cards, lying face down.  Zenia idly moves the cards around in random patterns while she waits for you to speak.</desc>

      <name>The Pool</name>
      <desc>The path leads from an archway on the southwest around a curve to the north.  Beside the path is a beautiful clear pool where two women sit talking and dangling their feet in the water. One of them is modest and temperate with the symbol of the third eye upon her forehead. The other smiles brightly as she talks and a star seems to hover just over her head. Flowering irises blossom at the water&apos;s edge and birds sing in the surrounding bushes.</desc>

      <name>Beneath the Willow Gift Shop</name>
      <desc>A wizened old man pops up from behind a rickety wooden counter and greets you with a jaundiced look.  The branches of the willow form a green wall from which fire-fly lanterns hang. Erected around the leafy space are shelves laden with woven baskets. Rose quartz crystals, lucky rabbits feet, crystal pyramids and all manner of other charms and trinkets, are piled high in the baskets which each sport a neatly written price tag. T-shirts with quirky sayings and pictures of the Major Arcana tarot cards appear to be on sale today.</desc>
      <desc>     To the north is an opening into the tree trunk itself. A wobbly looking sign by the trunk states; &quot;Mystic Zenia predicts your future is about to be 50 groats lighter&quot;</desc>

      <name>A Mist Shrouded Clearing</name>
      <desc>Your shuttle sits in a clearing surrounded by moss-hung trees.  A thick mist floats above the ground and swirls around your ankles as you move.  Flaming torches levitate in mid-air, lighting the way through the gloom to bright archways to the northeast, east and south. To the west is a very large weeping willow tree that seems to glow from beneath the drooping branches.</desc>
      <desc>   A stone plinth in the middle of the clearing bears an inscription almost completely covered by lichen. &quot;Quantum Consciousness Drive ships available - focus energy and concentrate.&quot;</desc>

      <name>The Wheel of Fortune Exchange</name>
      <desc>Traders and merchants relax on brightly coloured blankets on a grassy hillside, watching the enormous wheel that spins in the sky on an unseen axis. Jesters in piebald costumes parade between the picnic spots carrying placards with the latest commodity prices on them.  Fortunes rise and fall as the wheel turns but nobody seems to mind.  They simply wait for the wheel to spin a profit for them.  All things change in time.</desc>
      <desc>    Vendors meander amonst the crowd, selling treats from wicker baskets and drinks in cool clay jugs.</desc>

      <name>You awake to the sound of baring trumpets...</name>
      <desc>An angel is blowing her horn loud enough to wake the dead as you struggle to get out of the casket that you have apparently been sleeping in. Quite how you got here is unclear. &quot;Here&quot; appears to be a cemetery but all the graves are open and unoccupied.  Iron gates to the southeast look promising as a way out and as you start towards them you recognize the tune that the angel is massacring with the trumpet.. &quot;another one bites the dust..&quot;</desc>

      <name>A Path</name>
      <desc>The stoney path you are traversing seems to separate night from day here. To one side is bright sunlight shining down on a beautiful garden, while to the other the moon casts it&apos;s silvery beams onto a shimmering pool.  The howl of dogs echos across the night side but the laughter of children is heard from the garden. To the north is an archway while other paths lead southeast and southwest.</desc>

      <name>A Secret Bower</name>
      <desc>Deep within the dense undergrowth is a private little hiding place, not tall enough for most to stand up in but surprisingly roomy. Branches are interwoven to form the lush green walls. A patchwork blanket has been spread upon the ground and a stocked picnic basket sits open, offering delicious treats. Some thoughtful person has left a bowl of ripe fresh strawberries and a bottle of champaign in an icebucket.</desc>

      <name>The Path</name>
      <desc>A set of iron gates on the northwest side of the path are locked tight. An impressive stone wall with a heavy wrought iron gate lies to the south. From a tree by the wall, a young man hangs upside down, tied by his ankle to a limb. He seems not the least bit perturbed by his precarious position but is engrossed in a book titled &quot;Hazed and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.</desc>

      <desc>The path ends in a pictuesque wooded glade where an angellic figure is glowering at the surrounding undergrowth. &quot;Alright you two, come out now!  This isn&apos;t funny any more&quot;. The angel seems quite flustered and not at all aware of your prescence. There&apos;s a lot of rustling and giggling coming from a patch of dense shubs and a pair of five inch high heeled shoes is slung carelessly over a branch nearby.</desc>

      <desc>A gravel path stretches between the iron gates to the north and a stone mansion to the south.  Park land on either side of the path stetches as far as the eye can see.  A brightly striped marqee has been set up on the gass and outside it a young girl is taking a nap with her head resting on a very large snoozing lion. Close by, a man is carefully polishing the livery on a two-wheeled chariot.</desc>
      <desc>    A wooden sign by the marquee reads &quot;Next Show One Hour&quot;</desc>

      <name>Mansion Foyer</name>
      <desc>This high ceilinged foyer is bright and airy. Your footsteps echo from the marble floor to the lofty Baroque ceiling above you.  Looking up you can&apos;t help but notice a woman performing a trapeze act within a suspended ring of laurel leaves. At least it appears to be a trapeze act.  You can&apos;t quite make out the actual equipment she must be using as she spins and dances over head.</desc>
      <desc>On a small semi-circular table sits a newspaper with the headline: &quot;Goddess Bella Denies Part in Dr Fogg Video.. pictures on page 3&quot;</desc>
      <desc>The front door is north. There&apos;s a large ornate door to the south.  The sign by the barricaded eastern exit reads &quot;Tower closed due to lightning hazard&quot;</desc>

      <name>The Throne Room</name>
      <desc>Before you on their thrones sit the Emperor and the Empress of Tarot. The Emperor&apos;s rather stoney expression is countered by the Empress&apos;s warm smile as she watches the court Jester perform.  The Emperor is talking quietly with a serious looking lady in legal garb. Courtiers mingle and chatter in the great hall and help themselves to a magnificent buffet set to the side of the room.</desc>
