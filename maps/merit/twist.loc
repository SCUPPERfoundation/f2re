      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>The footpath narrows somewhat as it curves and you overtake another traveler reverently kneeling before a tiny white flower, taking dozens of close up photographs, his nose practically touching the flower.  His passion for his interest is appealing, if somewhat unusual.  You may walk SE or SW.</desc>

      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>You see a large flat boulder, perfect for taking a break from the climb.  You people-watch those continuing the climb and those returning towards the LP and notice the returnees are all engaged in animated conversations, whereas those climbing appear introspective.  When you&apos;re rested, you may continue SE or SW.</desc>

      <name>The Summit</name>
      <desc>You have reached the top of a large hill, still dwarfed by surrounding mountains.   Three log cabins have been built here.  One is enveloped by picnic tables and many are consuming the food and drink they just purchased or brought with them.  Another cabin seems to house the staff, and on its outside wall you see a hoverpod schedule.  Apparently, there are hourly hoverpod flights back Out to the LP.  A large, multi-roomed cabin is in the center, a small line of people waiting outside.  Each person seems deep in thought, and you are reluctant to ask why they&apos;re waiting.  You can get IN line, or return SW.</desc>

      <name>The Guilding Light</name>
      <desc>It&apos;s finally your turn.  Upon entering, you see a pleasant looking bearded man seated in a wing back chair, beckoning you to join him.  You sit across from him, not sure what to do.  He smiles and correctly guesses, &quot;You&apos;re a tourist, aren&apos;t you, with no idea what I do here.&quot;  He explains he&apos;s a psychiatrist who withdrew from the established practices of his field in order to pursue unothodox approaches to mental health for people who seek him out.  Nicknamed the Guiding Light, he offers advice, a friendly ear and sometimes radical suggestions.  He stares into your eyes searchingly, evaluates your body language and declares, &quot;There&apos;s nothing a good night&apos;s sleep won&apos;t fix.&quot;</desc>
      <desc>With that, you realize you&apos;ve been dismissed, and go OUT.</desc>

      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>You see several people, whom you might describe as &quot;characters&quot; climbing this gentle sloping pathway and decide to follow.  Directly in front of you walks a family, all with impossibly long hair and what looks like homespun clothes.</desc>
      <desc>You enjoy the tiny purple wildflowers along the way.  Continue NE or SW.</desc>

      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>From this vantage point you can see the Launch Pad below, and the equipment and shuttles begin to look small in comparison with the mountains all around.  Walking more rapidly than most, you pass a group of youths, all bearing small, gaily wrapped gifts in their hands, their faces bright with anticipation.  For what is still a mystery to you.  You may walk SE or NW.</desc>

      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>You notice a brisk little stream running close to the footpath.  Its clear water reveals tiny little fish darting every which way.  Some children are giggling as they watch the fish, trying to catch them unsuccessfully with their small hands.  The footpath continues NE or SW.</desc>

   <location num='934'>
      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>The trees are somewhat less dense here, and you begin to hear the scurrying of small mammals, catching an occasional glimpse of brown fur.  The air seems fresher and cleaner and you inhale it with enjoyment.  You may walk SE or NW.</desc>

      <name>Winding Way</name>
      <desc>The dirt and gravel of the footpath gives way to carefully placed flat stones and little steps along the steeper areas.  There is even a wooden handrail around one particularly uphill area.  There is a sharp curve ahead.  You look back and realize you have come quite a distance from the LP and hope to get back before dark, having seen no lighting along the footpath.  You may go NE or SW.</desc>

      <name>Twist Exchange</name>
      <desc>This is a standard enough exchange with vidscreens listing all commodities, but a quarter of the chamber is devoted to Trading Forms.  Self-proclaimed and bonafide experts in trading handicap all the markets and epublish recommendations (the so-called trading forms) of suggested buys and sells on a minute to minute basis, updated constantly.  Some investors swear by their favorite investment handicappers who have colorful names.  You see stalls for Sam&apos;s Swaps, Speculating Sheila, Donny the Dealer, Sassy Assets and more.  The LP is EAST.</desc>

      <name>Twist Launch Pad</name>
      <desc>You find yourself in an expansive valley surrounded by towering, snow capped mountains.  Hoverpod operators approach you offering to fly you to your destination.  Most travel is by air because of the rugged terrain.  You consider waving them off, when you see the LP Rest Stop, because it&apos;s been awhile since you&apos;ve had a meal.  The Exchange is WEST.  Other destinations are NE or SE.</desc>

      <desc>A level pasture covered with buttercups is on your right, and some cows and goats are grazing there.   Further removed now from the din of the launch pad, you can hear the cheerful music of several different species of bird.  The path goes NE or NW.</desc>

      <desc>In this beautiful unspoiled locale, you are surprised when you come to a carefully crafted sign beside the footpath.  &quot;You&apos;re almost there!&quot; it announces.  You notice others on the path who point with excitement at the sign and quicken their pace.  Almost where, you wonder?  The path continues NE or NW.</desc>

      <name>Tourist Center</name>
      <desc>Automated kiosks are lined in concentric circles, providing all information a traveler needs.  From this location you can make hotel and dining arrangements, sign up for excursions, or arrange for travel on Twist.  Exits are E, SE, SW.  The Launch Pad is directly NW.</desc>

      <name>Excursions</name>
      <desc>Although most visitors to Twist prefer to explore on their own, given the challenging terrain, several excursions are perenniel attractions.  The &quot;All Day Triple Play&quot; Excursion is the best bargain, and you can step SE into the hoverpod if you&apos;ve bought your ticket.  Fleet Flights are East or you can return West.</desc>

      <name>Fleet Flights</name>
      <desc>Charter flights can be arranged to remote areas in Twist, weather permitting.  A flight leaves shortly for The Crown of Twist, one of the planet&apos;s highest mountains.  To board, take the UP ramp.  You may also go westward, leading to the LP.</desc>

      <name>Dagny&apos;s Parlor</name>
      <desc>You are amused by the whimsical decor of Dagny&apos;s parlor.  Various antique machines, containers and obsolete curiosities compose the bulk of the furnishings.  The end table, for example, is an old butter churn.  Several workathingies seem to be doing the housework and one offers you refreshments.  Wonderful smells are emanating from the kitchen area, but a workathingie bars your way.  The exit is East.</desc>

   <location num='1119'>
      <name>Dagny&apos;s House</name>
      <desc>You see a pleasant looking, coral colored stucco one story house.  Flowering shrubs are generously clustered around it.  You never know when Dagny may stop by, her schedule being very erratic, much like this planet.  Something happened in the terraforming process to disturb the orbit, but for now, scientists predict it will eventually normalize.   This has not discouraged settlement here, although for some reason, the planet seems to appeal to quirky individuals.  Dagny&apos;s parlor is West, or you may leave the house by going NE.</desc>

      <name>Hotel District</name>
      <desc>Several hotels for every wallet have ample vacancies for travelers.  Twist is a bit off the beaten path, so the tourist trade is still a growing industry.  Ranging from grandiose accommodations to microhotels, from boutique hotels to modest lodgings, there&apos;s plenty of choice, although the big chain hotels seem to be absent.  The restaurant district is just beyond to the SW, or you can go NW.</desc>

      <name>Twisted Zoo</name>
      <desc>The hoverpod deposits you in the Twisted Zoo, an unusual collection of animal life situated on a plateau between mountains.   The result of genetic experiments, the animals on display here have been bred to thrive in specific planetary conditions.  Using xenografting, cloning and manipulation of an animal&apos;s DNA, scientists are not just creating interesting new animal species, but some are being developed with human DNA for medical purposes.</desc>
      <desc>The animals you observe seem healthy and are kept in spacious, natural enclosures.  You are bemused by the geeps, ligons, and bearcats.  You are amazed by the wolves who have been bred to walk upright.  Hoverpods will take you SE or NW.</desc>

      <name>Restaurant Row</name>
      <desc>One nice thing about a planet of individualists is that all kinds of restaurants are established to attract customers.  Whether you&apos;re a vegan or want all dairy, whether you follow the total protein diets, seafood or just want refined cooking - there&apos;s a restaurant here for you.  Knowing Dagny&apos;s penchant for French comfort foods, you are leaning towards trying La Creperie.  Exit NE.</desc>

      <name>Twist Colony</name>
      <desc>Tourists love to gawk at the residents of Twist Colony.  The colony was established as an enclave within Twist where the only rules were the basic ones of not physically hurting others nor taking their belongings.  The colony survives economically on tourist dollars, so the residents accept the intrusion, mainly ignoring outsiders.  Today is the annual body painting/bicycle parade.  Participants get totally nude and artists paint their bodies completely, sometimes with abstractions, sometimes to make them look like animals or objects or as if they&apos;re wearing clothes.  They then bicycle through the colony, showing off the artwork.  What&apos;s striking is that none of them actually look naked.  Tomorrow, the expressive dance gathering will occur.  Hoverpods will take you SE or NW.</desc>

      <name>The Crown of Twist</name>
      <desc>Your ears are still popping from the steep ascent into the mountains.  You also feel a little light headed from the thin air.  All that is forgotten, however as you step out and drink in the view.  You feel as if you are standing on top of the world, and you&apos;re actually grateful for the hand railings which make you feel less dizzy.  It&apos;s very quiet here, and you keep turning in every direction to view other peaks, appreciating the sunlight glinting on the snowy crests.  You could stay here forever, but when you&apos;re ready, you can board your flight by taking the ramp DOWN.</desc>
