Federation 2: Teaching Edition
==============================

Setup Guide for Researchers:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:SCUPPERfoundation/f2te.git
$ cd f2te
$ cmake .
$ make
```

Take the proverbial â˜• break.
It should compile if you have figured out the dependencies you need, like
we did several weeks ago when we first started testing this...

Now try:
```
$ ./fed2d
Cannot get password structure for 'fed2' account.
Success
Home directory is '/$HOME/f2te/log/fed2.log'

 --- Starting Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970 (UTC/GMT)---
Unable to find /$HOME/f2te/maps

```
Then proceed to commit the readme here, while you figure out where to
download the maps.
