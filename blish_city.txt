Blish Cities

1. Named after the legendary atomic era writer James Blish, who first popularised
the concept of spacefaring cities cruising around looking for work. NOTE: if you
want the word 'City' in the name, you need to include it!

2. Cities have a name, belong to a cartel and can be allocated to any planet in
the owning cartel.

3. Cities have an economic level, and they can produce commodities within that level.

4. Cities have up to five slots for production, each commodity produced must be
from their economic level. You can have more than one slot producing the same
commodity.s

5. Each slot has a capacity of between 8 and 12 inclusive (random) production points.

6. It takes two days to retool for new production if a change is made to any slot.
During this time production is halted.

7. Cities produce income for the cartel as well as the production for the planet.

8. Very occasionally they will produce exotic commodities/objects for the cartel
owner (not yet in!)

9. Cities may only be configured by the cartel owner, except that the planet owner
may also change the production - in which case the cartel owner will be notified.
(ie the cartel is the owner of the city, but the planet owner is the 'customer')

10. A planet may only employ one Blish city at a time.


Building Blish Cities

1. Only one can be built at a time, and only on the cartel's prime planet.

2. To build cities you need a graving dock.

Notes for alan:

No rioting while being built
Sort out leaving cartel when have a city

XML format:
<blish-city name="Flying Dutchman" cartel="Sol" planet="Earth" econ="resource" slots="3">
	<production commod="xmetals" start="1"/>
	<production commod="alloys"/>
	<production commod="crystals"/>
</blish-city>

Syndicate parser needs to change to handle blish-city stuff
Blish-city building yard (graving dock) needs coding
