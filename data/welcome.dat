Hi there,

I see you recently set up a new character in the space fantasy game Federation 2. I'm writing to you to say, Welcome!

Federation is a free space fantasy game, an interstellar adventure of economics and politics, with an ongoing party for you to join when you need a break from commerce and intrigue.

Fed2 is free, but we support the running of the game by giving you the chance to buy extras to make your gameplay more enjoyable or efficient. See http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/extras/index.html for details.

If you are using a Windows computer, we recommend that you play Fed2 using our special front-end, FedTerm, which you can download from http://www.ibgames.net/fed2/fedterm/index.html.

If you need any help to get started in Fed2, email feedback@ibgames.com and I will do my best to help you (please put Fed2 somewhere in the subject line to avoid the dreaded spam filters).

There's also lots of useful and fun stuff on our web site, at http://www.ibgames.net, including manuals, maps, background information on the game universe, and a weekly news bulletin about the game, the Fed II Star.

If you see me in the game, say "Hi" and I will buy you a drink! Have fun playing Fed II.

Regards,

     the demi-goddess Hazed
